A student who is pursuing postgraduate studies alongside undergraduate studies may also be appointed as a doctoral researcher if such an arrangement is based on a confirmed postgraduate system in the faculty. The aim is to complete the doctoral degree in four years and also typical duration of the work contract for a doctoral researcher is 4 years, with a maximum of 5 years. The idea is that the contract should be for the whole duration of the project, avoiding short contracts.  For the 2024-2027 doctoral pilot, the duration of the contract will be 3 years. Salary: Requirement level 2: Beginning of the studies Requirement level 3: Midpoint of completing the work required for the doctoral degree Requirement level 4: The supervisor estimates that the student can publicly defend the dissertation in approximately one year. Doctoral Researcher's work plans must be drawn up so that participation in teaching and other activities will allow the students to complete their dissertations within the planned schedule. According to the collective agreement, no more that 5% of the annual workload should be allocated to teaching, and when possible, the teaching should be related to the student’s field of research. The stage of the doctoral thesis should also be taken into consideration, both when assigning duties and weighing the duration of the employment. For example, during the latter stages of dissertation work, the doctoral student may need a longer period of time to focus on finishing the dissertation. During this time, the doctoral researcher may be completely relieved from other duties. The Doctoral Researcher's work plan may include teaching and other tasks specific to the unit. For example, it has been found that a good way to promote the completion of degrees is to assign doctoral students as 'tutor teachers' so that undergraduate students who are close to graduation can receive support in their own field."
