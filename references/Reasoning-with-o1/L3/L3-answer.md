# Order Fulfillment Plan

1. **Fetch and Review New Orders**
    a. Call the `fetch_new_orders()` function to retrieve the list of awaiting orders.
    b. For each `order` in the fetched orders:
        - Extract `order_id`, `customer_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `destination`, `weight`, and `dimensions`.

2. **Process Each Order Individually**
    a. **Check Inventory Availability**
        - Call the `get_inventory_status(product_id)` function with the `product_id` from the order.
        - If the available inventory is **greater than or equal to** the `quantity` ordered:
            i. Proceed to allocate stock.
        - **Else**:
            i. Calculate the `shortage_quantity` needed to fulfill the order.
            ii. Proceed to handle the shortage.

    b. **Allocate Stock for Available Inventory**
        - Call the `allocate_stock(order_id, product_id, quantity)` function with the respective `order_id`, `product_id`, and `quantity`.
        - Call the `update_inventory(product_id, -quantity)` function to deduct the allocated stock from inventory.

    c. **Arrange Shipping for Allocated Orders**
        - Call the `calculate_shipping_options(destination, weight, dimensions)` function using the order's `destination`, `weight`, and `dimensions`.
        - From the available shipping options returned, select the most cost-effective and timely `carrier_id` and `service_level`.
        - Call the `book_shipment(order_id, carrier_id, service_level)` function with the selected shipping details.

    d. **Notify Customer of Successful Allocation and Shipping**
        - Prepare a `message` informing the customer that their order has been allocated and shipped.
        - Call the `send_order_update(customer_id, order_id, message)` function with the respective `customer_id`, `order_id`, and `message`.

    e. **Handle Inventory Shortages**
        - **If** there is a `shortage_quantity` for the order:
            i. **Check Production Capacity**
                - Call the `check_production_capacity('immediate')` function to determine if immediate production can cover the `shortage_quantity`.
                - **If** production capacity is sufficient:
                    - Call the `schedule_production_run(product_id, shortage_quantity, 'immediate')` function to initiate production.
                    - Proceed to arrange shipping once production is complete.
                - **Else**:
                    - Call the `check_available_suppliers()` function to retrieve a list of potential suppliers.
                    - For each `supplier` in the available suppliers:
                        - Call the `get_supplier_info(supplier_id)` function to obtain details about the components and available quantities.
                        - **If** the supplier can provide the needed components:
                            - Call the `place_purchase_order(supplier_id, component_id, shortage_quantity)` function to order the required components.
                            - Break the loop after successfully placing the purchase order.
                    - **Else**:
                        - Notify the customer about the delay and provide an estimated fulfillment date.
                        - Call the `send_order_update(customer_id, order_id, message)` function with the relevant notification.

3. **Prioritize and Manage Backlog Orders**
    a. After processing all orders with available inventory, identify any remaining backlog orders.
    b. For each backlog `order`:
        - Repeat steps 2.e.i to 2.e.ii to handle shortages by scheduling production or ordering components as necessary.

4. **Finalize Order Processing**
    a. Ensure all allocated and produced orders have been shipped and customers have been notified.
    b. Review and update inventory levels to reflect all allocations and production runs.

5. **Complete Instructions**
    - Call the `instructions_complete` function to signify the end of the order fulfillment process.
