Life, work, and COVID intervened. I wouldn’t have finished \nit now without threats and encouragements from close friends and \ncolleagues, particularly Kate Lacey, who told me to stop, and Sarah \nKember and Kate O’Riordan, who told me to keep going – it’s true \nwe wrote a different book together, but this one is finished because \nof that one.\nThis project was completed at Cambridge but it began at Sussex \nUniversity, and I also worked on it during my time as the Sanomat \nFellow at the hugely hospitable Helsinki Collegium for Advanced \nStudies (HCAS). Thanks are due to many at the international com-\nmunity of scholars at HCAS for feedback and for many inspiring \ndiscussions. Huge thanks are also due to my former colleagues in \nthe School of Media, Film and Music (MFM) at Sussex. I am \nparticularly indebted to the MFM Women’s Reading Group for their \nforensic feedback. I’d also like to acknowledge a debt to Ben Roberts, \nwhose thinking has influenced the discussions of 1960s cybernation \ndebates and of contemporary automation anxiety in this book very \ndirectly.\nAbove all I want to thank past and present members of the Sussex \nHumanities Lab; in particular James Baker, David Berry, Kat Bray-\nbrooke, Alice Eldridge, Beatrice Fazi, Wes Goatley, Emma Harrison, \nTim Hitchcock, Ben Jackson, Sally Jane Norman, Ben Roberts, Rachel \nThomson, Amelia Wakeford, Sharon Webb and David Weir; but \nthere were many more people there who were inspiring, cheering, \nor noisy in a good way. Modular synth and robot opera have nothing \nto do with the contents of this book, but the sanity of people working \nin those areas saved mine.\nx Acknowledgements\nSome other acknowledgements are due; I interviewed Alice Mary \nHilton in New York shortly before her death. Her recollections were \nnot always comfortable, but they opened a door into an earlier \nmoment of automation fever and began this project. I’d also like \nto acknowledge the Special Collections unit at the University of \nSussex, where the Matusow Collection is housed, and to salute the \ninfinitely patient Matthew Frost and others at Manchester University \nPress.

Anti-computing is a pause, a stop, a refusal, \nan objection, a sense, an emotion, a response, a popular campaign, \na letter, an essay, a code-work, a theorist, a sensibility, an ambience, \nan absolute hostility, a reasoned objection, a glitch, a hesitation, an \nambient dislike. It may be articulated by a human, a crowd, a \nnetwork, or by a program that refuses to run. It may also be an \nelement of an assemblage containing many other elements; some of \nthem in conflict.\nAnti-computing takes many forms. It is unique to its moments \nof emergence, but is also characterized by recurrence. Many (though \nnot all) of the components of anti-computing today are familiar \neven if they arise in response to a specific formation ‘as if new’, \neven if the claim is that the issues they address are graver than ever \nbefore, entailing qualitatively higher – even existential – stakes. \nAnti-computing may emerge as something felt and believed, something \ncultivated. It may be presented as a rationally adopted position or \ncritique, a feeling (perhaps a yuck factor), or it may be an operation. \nIt is articulated as an individual view, a collective one, as a one-off, \nand as a circulating and time-travelling discourse (operating syn-\nchronously and diachronically – albeit in the latter case in disrupted \nways). As a human response to the global embedding of the com-\nputational it materializes in heterogeneous ways, but since humans, \nafter all, are not separate from the machines with which they co-\nevolve, this materialization entails technologies as well as humans. \nIt is indeed partly technological.\n2 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nAnti-computing is all of these things at once because it is part \nof, and responds to, a formation that is itself pervasive, intrusive, \nambient, emergent, installing, materially heterogeneous. I am talking, \nof course, of the computational, and of computational culture; about \na history, about informational capitalism now, and about the \ncomputationally saturated and only partly foreseeable future. \nComputers have spread. They have spread further and faster than \nearlier human generations imagined possible – or that earlier genera-\ntions of computer appeared to make feasible. There are over two \nbillion computers in the world, and many billions more embedded \ncontrol circuits. There will be 20 billion sensors in the world by the \nend of the 2020s, the decade we have already entered as I complete \nthis book. The numbers become meaningless – though their sheer \nweight remains significant. The extent of the computational has \nbroadened and deepened; networking the world, entering the body, \nreaching into Space.\nIn view of this relentless expansion, campaigns against computeriza-\ntion, anti-computing critiques, hostile interventions, writings ‘against’, \nin the academy and in popular culture, might be judged to have \ncomprehensively failed. Certainly, if the measure of success is less \nnot more computing, then they haven’t worked. Anti-computing \narises within horizons that have been – and still are – dominated \nby acceptance of the computational and its expansion, whether this \nacceptance is constituted as compliance, enthusiasm, indifference, \nacceptance, disavowal, or fatalism; all these have surfaced as responses \nover the seven decades or more since early computers first made an \nappearance in public, during which time computerization has been \na live social issue. Anti-computing is, viewed in relation to this \nmassive and apparently unstoppable advent, and in view of mass \nacceptance of it, an exceptional response to computerization, relatively \nrare, relatively rarely consistently expressed, even more rarely persist-\ning, or becoming an organized movement. Of course, since the late \n2010s and now in the 2020s, there has been an efflorescence of \ncommentary – governmental, cultural, social, academic – expressing \nor exposing hostility and concern about the digital. Arguably we \nare in a renewed age of amplified automation anxiety (Bassett and \nRoberts, 2020). Consider the endlessly multiplying channels across \nwhich this anxiety runs the (digital) production processes that make \nit (increasingly digital), or simply consider the growth in the number \n Anti-computing: a provisional taxonomy  3\nof sensors in the world since, say, Jaron Lanier’s 2010 You are not \na Gadget, which might have been an automation anxiety outlier \nand the latest internet scare book to be up-marketed on Amazon.\nGiven the above, it is legitimate to wonder whether critical thinking, \nwritings, campaigns, or interventions of other kinds ‘against comput-\ning’ matter. Or how they matter. For instance, do they make a \nsignificant intervention, are they significant historically, do they \npersist; how do earlier forms of anti-computing connect with \ncontemporary anti-computational turns? Or, to introduce another \nregister, do they suggest ways in which a different attitude towards \na techno-socially saturated future and present might be cultivated? \nCould this be one which responds to a situation in which compu-\ntational capitalism has reached the limits of viable expansion \n(environmentally) even as its growth continues? This is one of the \nways the world is being broken, and one of the ways we are not \nrepairing it. What do different forms of hostility or refusal suggest \nabout the terms of the exchange or interaction between computers \nand (other) material and immaterial elements: bodies, discourses, \ntexts, and (other) machines, intelligent or not; and what kind of \nalternative propositions can they open up – even in, or by way of, \ntheir intransigent refusal to conform?\nThe wager of this book is that historically arising and contemporary \nanti-computing formations matter and have more to do with each \nother than might at first appear. One example: contemporary surveil-\nlance concerns and hostility to comprehensive data capture by states \nare often explained as arising because of new data-capture techniques \n(big data), but they are also partly shaped by, and certainly resonate \nwith, at least thirty years of fears of a data society. We have figurations \nand imaginaries to reach for when we discuss data surveillance, \neven as we declare it all new when we encounter it in a specific \nform, or at a specific moment, as a crisis not yet narrativized and \nthereby contained, let alone simply turned into information (Doane, \n1990). You might say we reach for old stories, but we also need to \nask how these stories materialize in new ways.\nHow, then, is anti-computing to be investigated? In particular, \nhow are anti-computing moments of the past to be identified, given \nthe thoroughness with which the relentless march of computerization \nobliterates traces of earlier resistance, hesitancy, and hostility in its \nrush to claim the present, and given its designs on, its foreclosure \n4 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nof, the future? Furthermore, once ‘found’, how are such formations \nto be explored? Addressing this last question demands not only \nidentifying traces of the anti-computational, it also provokes a \nreconsideration of how the materials and discourses involved in its \nformation and articulation may be theorized and understood in \nrelation to specific or located instantiations, and more broadly.\nA dominant – teleological – understanding of ‘what technology \ndoes to society’ doesn’t help to address these questions. It buries \nthem. Computerization is often visualized as an inexorable progres-\nsion. This progression, often taken to be synonymous with human \nprogress, or understood as its leading edge, attracts support; at its \nmost ardent this becomes quasi eschatological – something like the \nhope and desire for new gods, or a new regime of power to solve \nthe problems of an old order. The latter is a sensibility evident in \nstrong versions of singularity discourse, which see in artificial intel-\nligence (AI) the chance to generate new kinds of post-human super-\nbeing. But a sense of the inexorability of computational growth also \ninfuses visions of the coming quotidian, and is widely offered as a \nmatter of fact, the apparently given and unarguable reality of the \npresent and of the future. Computers, it is widely argued, are not \nonly shaping life today but are increasingly also dictating the way \nthe future will go. Granted, it may also be admitted by those who \nwish to follow it that this path is not entirely foreseeable. The \ncomplexity of interwoven processes of innovation, and perhaps also \nthe much-heralded arrival of new forms of generative complexity, \nnotably through advancements in machine learning, mean the logics \nof computerization are not fully possible to discern (at least by \nhumans – and there is still nobody else). Despite this, however, the \ntrajectory of much commentary on digital futures suggests a belief \nthat – unknowable though they are – what is known is that these \nimprevisible logics will out. This belief, which is essentially teleologi-\ncal, turns any obstacles to the further advancement of computing \n– whether these concern narrowly technical issues, bottlenecks, reverse \nsalients, or social tools including legislation – into temporary impedi-\nments to what will come, obstructions that will be routed around, \nsooner or later. Viewed from this perspective anti-computing interven-\ntions too, whether they come as intellectual broadsides, or emerge \nas circulating hostile discourses amongst various publics or as aesthetic \nor literary interventions, will only ever momentarily stall the disruptive \n Anti-computing: a provisional taxonomy  5\nenergy of change, the forward march. They are, that is, deemed to \nbe doomed to eventual failure or terminal subsidence. What are \nraised as problems concerning digital automation/instantiation – \ndigital culture, AI for instance – may be taken seriously whilst \nmaintaining this general perspective, but they are nonetheless also \nunderstood as proximate problems, as problems that ‘we’ may expect \nto overcome in time.\nConsider the very different responses to the computational found \nin Joseph Weizenbaum’s critique of the logicality/rationality equation, \nin Hannah Arendt’s attack on the cybercultural idealists of mid-1960s \nNew York, in F.R. Leavis’ attack on technologico-Benthamism, in \nanti-database elements of the US and UK counter-cultures (all dis-\ncussed here), or consider the more recent writings of Morozov (2012), \nPariser (2012), Lanier (2010), Noble (2018), Hawking (2015), \nrespectively railing against the cloud, the crowd, algorithmically \naccelerated racial bias, and the rise of computer intelligence. All \npartake of something I am terming the anti-computational. All are \n– if the dominant logics of computational progress are accepted – \nsideshows to the main event. They have been or will be absorbed, \nset aside, sidelined, routed around, dismissed, put in their proper \nplace. It isn’t an accident that futile or mindless resistance is the \npopular (and distorted) meaning currently widely ascribed to \nLuddism,1 or that the term Luddite is now invoked far more often \nin relation to computational technologies than to its original contexts.2 \nPerhaps this is why an avowed technological Luddism, proffered as \na form of computational dissent, never had much purchase, though \nit was demanded in the early years of the public internet (see e.g. \nWebster and Robins, 1986) and is undergoing something of a recur-\nrence (e.g. Lachney and Dotson, 2018).\nA sense of the inexorable expansion of the computational is easily \ndiscerned as long standing, part of a structure of feeling emerging \nalongside the digital as it becomes pervasive in 20th- and 21st-century \nsocieties (albeit unevenly distributed). Consider the ‘drift’ (in fact \na powerfully flowing current) towards the adoption by nation-states \nof bulk surveillance techniques no longer based on ‘need to know’ \nrationales but on exhaustive capture, which may be disliked by \nmany but which are not being widely or systematically contested. \nSurveillance has already become embedded, an intrinsic part of the \nwider social architecture (and not only in the West), including the \n6 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\narchitecture of the built environment and of the self (see e.g. \nAndrejevic, 2015). Infra-structuralization produces a lockdown, not \nonly cementing technological systems but also constraining the \ncultural imaginaries that might let us imagine them operating in \nother ways, let alone not operating at all. The teleological horizon, \nthen, in the end acceding to a form of fatalism, leaves little space \nfor the impertinent intrusion of the anti-computational. Anti-\ncomputing, whether understood as worthy or foolish or tragic, \nhubristic or pathetic, ill conceived, optimistic, or even heroic, is \nwithin this horizon ultimately always to be understood as a futile \nform of resistance, at least if it intends to do more than rectify an \nimmediately correctable, temporally discrete anomaly.\nIn response, the wager of this book is that teleological readings \nof the computational, both those found in popular culture and \nthose generated by particular framings of the technological, can be \ndisputed, and that accounts that fail to register the significance of \ndissent and hostility can also be challenged – and should be. The \nanti-computational favours a dissonant reading of computational \nhistory, demands an alternative understanding of the technological, \nand can generate an alternative account of the actual and potential \nimpacts of the computational. It does so as an act of writing, but \nalso as an act of excavation.\nAcknowledging that anti-computing moments falter, and that \nanti-computing often fails, and that there are many positive aspects \nto the computational, I set out to acknowledge and explore dissent, \nhostility, antagonism, doubt, unease, in many forms. Teleological \naccounts of computational technologies and the computerization of \nculture, taking various explicit forms, working in multiple registers, \nsilently informing many accounts, need to be challenged. Both because \nthey operate in powerful ideological ways and because (partly because \nof this) they tell only half of a larger story; anti-computational \nformations are an element of, and an element essential to the \nunderstanding of, those processes which Bernard Stiegler memorably \ndefined in terms of a co-evolution between humans and technology \nand explored in relation to medium technological times in terms of \ngrammatization or exteriorization and its potentials for good or ill \n(Stiegler, 2013).\nThese are times in which assumptions of unlimited space for \ngrowth or progress, or of humans’ ultimate mastery of our world, \n Anti-computing: a provisional taxonomy  7\nare revealed – in the flames of Australia, or in the melting of the \nice, or in COVID-19 – to be the fictions that they always were. A \ntheory of technical co-evolution, challenging assumptions of mastery \nand control by ‘the human’ over ‘nature’ by challenging the boundaries \nbetween them, specifically challenges technologically enabled visions \nof automatic or open-ended progress. The engagements between \nthe computational and the environmental are complex and multi-\nlayered, but also brutally obvious; land poisoned by tech manufactur-\ning processes, the rise of throwaway culture, labour exploitation \naround rare metal mining for smartphone components, pollution, \nthe energy consumption of data lakes used in AI. These issues are \nexplored elsewhere (see Solnit, 2007, 2013, Bauman, 2003, for early \nengagement, and emerging writing in ecological digital humanities \nfor more contemporary treatments, including Yusoff, 2018, and \nSmith, 2011) and do not directly constitute the proximate subject \nmatter of this book. However, the broad attack on the presumption \nthat unlimited growth represents progress (and perhaps virtue), made \nfor instance by Latour and Haraway in discussions of technology \nand environmental limits, resonates with many explicit critiques of \nthe computational as the handmaiden of such forms of progress, \nand is present in a more amorphous form more widely (see Latour, \n2011, Haraway, 2016). Work by Timnit Gebru et al. on the high \nenvironmental/energy cost of expanding data lakes used in AI sharpens \nthe critique in relation to emerging technologies (Gebru, 2021).\nSignificance\nThe anti-computing formations I explore here are significant first \nof all because their very existence provides evidence that in earlier \ndecades the path ‘forwards’ towards greater computerization has \nnot been as direct as it appears to us in retrospect. Foucault (1972: \n14) talked of the ‘tranquilized sleep’ of a conventional history and \nasked how this might be disturbed. Anti-computing formations \npunctuate those breathless but still somnolent accounts in which \nthe ‘progress’ of the computerization of culture, viewed as the latest/\nlast work of humans, is assured through the smooth and relentless \napplication of (computer) science. An exploration going by way of \nthe anti-computational exploits this disruption and theorizes its \n8 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nsignificance. Anti-computing can be understood in this respect as a \npartly theoretical construction or methodology, one which isn’t quite \narchaeological in Foucault’s sense, nor quite a media archaeology, \nbut which shares with both of these some interests in discontinuity, \nseries, scales, irreducibility, and looped connection, seeking out and \nexploiting the possibilities opened by interruption – and systematizing \nthem where possible.\nAnti-computing exposes other ways of seeing the history of com-\nputational adoption and expansion, and discerns ratios operating \nbetween humans and machines other than those most conventionally \nremarked upon. Of course, there are multiple ways in which dominant \nforms of computational culture – computational capitalism and its \ngrowth logics – are questioned. The anti-computational moment \nrelates to other forms of resistance, for instance those that can be \nframed as doing otherwise (hacking ‘fixes’ to reopen apparently \nfinished technologies, the adoption of alternative modes of use, \nturning data against its owners, all are good examples here and are \nalso much studied; see e.g. Jordan, 2017). Anti-computing makes its \npoint differently. Its modus operandi is dissent. It tends to prioritize \nrefusal and critique over appropriation. This matters partly because, \nas is increasingly clear in relation to commodity culture and culture \njamming, appropriation only too easily produces reappropriation \n– net autonomy was always going to be temporary, as Hakim Bey \n(1991) put it long ago. Dissent may (also) jam up the technological \nimaginary, but this time through forms of distancing, refusal, doubt, \nrejection. Anti-computing is not about playing with, but rather about \nnot playing at all, or at the very least about questioning the logics \nof the game.\nA certain irritation might be legitimate at this point; what is \nanti-computing? So far, I have defined it as a series of found and \ngenerated responses to the computational that wish to question some \nof the powerful assumptions about the inevitability of computational \ntechnology and computational growth and/as progress. I have sug-\ngested that they may be powerful in themselves, and that their \nexistence disrupts a story that is all too easy to tell, that threatens \nto tell itself. I have also begun to talk about anti-computing as \nan excavatory methodology. I recognize that these two definitions \nprovide only the beginnings of an answer, and they are intended to \nbe partial. In this book the term is allowed – indeed encouraged – to \n Anti-computing: a provisional taxonomy  9\nmorph, to expand and contract, and to change case. Indeed it is more \nthan a term, although the matter of terms is where I turn to next.\nComputing and anti-computing\nTo explore anti-computing demands some discussion of terms such \nas ‘computing’, ‘the computational’, and ‘computational culture’, \ngiven the multiple ways in which they are deployed. A computer is \na machine that operates on data according to a set of instructions \n(an algorithm). Digital computing is a particular instantiation of \nsuch a machine; this distinction can be clearly made – but it needs \nto be recognized that the two terms are endlessly switched in popular \nculture. The computational is not the cybernetic, certainly not as \nthis was defined by Norbert Wiener (1950), but some argue that \nthe latter constitutes something like the basic architecture of the \nformer. Competing definitions are common; computing ‘began’ with \nBabbage, or with Lovelace and programming, or with Hilbert’s \nwork on algorithms, or with Turing, or with the Turing Machine, \nor with Turing’s paper ‘Computable Numbers’ (Fazi, 2018). Or, in \ndeep media accounts, it began centuries sooner (Zielinksi, 2008). \nThese definitions inform more or less contemporary analyses of \ncomputerization processes in society and culture; consider Wing on \ncomputational thinking (2006), Lanier on the computational (2010), \nand Berry on the computational turn (2011).\nI employ some of these definitions here, chiefly using them in the \nfollowing ways. First, computing is taken to mean something reason-\nably close to Turing’s original definition of the universal machine, \ncapable of calculating according to coded instructions (Turing, 1950). \nThis draws attention to computing as a process and an operation \nwhich may be instantiated in many ways; on this basis the digital \n(digital computing) is a particular kind of computing, quantum \ncomputing another. It also allows that computational operations \nmay be components of assemblages taking many physical forms; \nthis is highly pertinent today as billions of embedded computer \ncontrollers animate and endlessly expand the emerging Internet of \nThings (itself a term now approaching senescence).\nSecond, computing, the computational, computers: all these are \nalso allowed to be umbrella terms, designating assemblages widely \n10 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nunderstood to be computers, and/or operations understood to be \ncomputational at the time of this writing, or in their time. Today \nthese include that expanded constellation of personal computers \n(PCs), tablets, cell phones, and cloud storage devices and facilities \nthat constitutes the network central to computer culture: the internet \nand the platforms. To this are added those things and processes that \nare computerized (becoming computer controlled, or ‘becoming’ \ncomputational operations) and that are, in the process, transformed, \noften via a process that might be termed ‘sensorship’. The qualifying \ncriterion for what constitutes a computational object or process isn’t \nabsolute and is contingent. In 2020 prototype driverless cars are \noften understood as computerized vehicles; their capacity to automate \nwhat has been viewed as a form of human manual and cognitive \nexpertise – driving – is what marks them out. But digital circuitry \nis of course deeply embedded in all reasonably modern cars (even \nmine, which still has cassette technology and mechanical windows), \neven though these are not conventionally recognized as (defined \nas) computational objects. The sociology of media-technological \ninnovation, with its exploration of the becoming invisible of \ntechnology through appropriation, which produces a culturally \ninformed sense of the technical per se, has much to teach here (see \ne.g. Silverstone, 1994, Hartmann, 2009). Similar ambiguities arise \nelsewhere. Consider smart homes technologies. Fridges transformed \nthrough their computerization (embedded sensors, storage, control \ncircuitry) into informational and media devices continue to perform \ntheir traditional chilling and storing functions. But what is milk to \nme is now information to a supermarket. The computational is a \nrelational category.\nDespite the flexibility of these terms computing does mean \nsomething, not only as a technical definition, indicating an assemblage \nwith the capacity to undertake particular operations, but also in \nthe shifting vernaculars of the everyday. Allowing for this I bring \ninto my orbit discussions that, despite the vagueness with which \nthey may adumbrate specific objects, or specific computational \ntechnologies, nonetheless focus hostility onto computing, or the \ncomputational moment, however they define it. This focus is some-\ntimes a part of a larger critique: of technology in general, singularity \nin general, or modernity in general, for instance, but it is there. This \nfocus shapes my own inquiries. Later in the book, for instance, I \n Anti-computing: a provisional taxonomy  11\nexplore Arendt’s treatment of automation, beginning not with The \nHuman Condition (1998 [1958]), a work of philosophy exploring \nthe viva activa, but by asking how Arendt fared among the cyber-\nenthusiasts and haters, industrial organizers, civil rights activists, \nand nascent tech industry professionals who argued with her face \nto face at a conference exploring the ‘threat’ (or promise) of new \nwaves of specifically computational automation or ‘cybernation’ in \nthe early 1960s.\nOne more definitional comment. I am wary of using ‘the com-\nputational’ as a term to replace ‘the digital’, at least if this switch \nis taken to mark an exact break point, since I don’t believe it does. \nTerms such as computational, digital, postdigital are invoked as \nperiodizing categories in cultural or critical theory and do have \nuseful heft as aesthetic provocations (on the postdigital see Florian \nCramer, 2014). However, their usage isn’t precise. In the case of the \ndigital and the postdigital, for instance, there is obvious slippage \nacross registers marking the aesthetic and the sociological – and \nthat produces the peril of an unexamined assumption that we’re all \nin this together, and all in the same place. We should ask of the \npostdigital, post for whom? post where? post when? – and recognize \nthat the response ‘it’s post for me!’ often isn’t good enough. Not \nleast because it fails to recognize (post)colonial issues of historical \ndiscrimination and normative legibility. In another context the scholar \nand artist Lewis R. Gordan has discussed these kinds of universalizing \nlabels in terms of the epistemic closures they produce, particularly \naround race (Gordan, cited in Evans, 2019), and this is apt.\nThe computational, then, is understood as a formation, one in \nwhich computational control logics dominate, but one which invokes \nand assembles many other actors in operation. The computational \ncultures that arise as the logics of computational assemblages expand \nthrough becoming operational are specific to particular times and \nplaces, which is to say they operate in relation to, and as an integral \npart of, specific political economies. Computational culture today \nis not necessarily isomorphic with neoliberalism as a political economy \nand a social order, although the computational is a key mode through \nwhich neoliberalism is organized and operates – and is also important \nin how it sees itself (as an information society, knowledge society, \nor, in so far as the label ‘computational capitalism’ is accepted, as \na computational society).\n12 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nAnti-computing instances\nIn this book anti-computing is explored from two directions. First \nvia a series of investigations of anti-computing in specific sites and \ncontexts, scattered across the seventy years or so of post-war comput-\ning. In each, the goal is to understand anti-computing in a particular \nsocial and material context, to ask what forms of understanding \nunderpinned anti-computational interventions (how the technological \nwas constituted as powerful, how it was understood in relation to \npolitical economic conditions pertaining, for instance, or what justifies \nmy labelling of it as anti-computational). These investigations focus \non some (of many) instances where aspects or instantiations of the \nforward march of the computational are attacked.\nThere are no pretensions to completeness here. They would be \nfrustrated, since anti-computing is found in many places, takes \nmultiple forms, and operates at different scales. Consider these various \niterations: campaigns against computer surveillance, for instance \nearly opposition to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 \nin the UK, were and are anti-computational, as were objections to \nthe potential data capture operations of a single software package, \nthe finance package Lotus 1–2–3 (an early example of a tightly \ndefined anti-computational moment). Then there were the bundles \nof assembled new technologies that promised to ‘cybernate’ various \nforms of work in the 1960s, or the electronic page make-up systems \ncentral to shifts in the print industry in the UK in the 1980s; both \naroused a hostility that was anti-computational. The UK print case \nis a useful example, since it illustrates how the anti-computational \ncan draw itself up into and articulate antagonisms far exceeding \nthe purely technological; the print industry wars were part of the \nThatcherite attack on trade unions and working-class organization \nin the UK in the 1980s (Cockburn, 1992). The computational informs \ncybernetic routes to the post-human – and so warnings against these \nforms of post-human existence may usefully be explored in anti-\ncomputational terms. Or – bathetically perhaps – consider those on \ntrains who prefer silence to electronic noise. Or those who prefer \nthick, rich, ‘real world’ contact to virtual interaction, or those who \ntake detox ‘holidays’ away from the saturated computationality of \neveryday life (see Harrison, 2020), or who call for organic community \nover techno-scientific culture, or who critique technocratic rationality \n Anti-computing: a provisional taxonomy  13\nas that which will hollow out the political world. All of these positions \nand arguments are examples of anti-computing. Some of them are \nexplored further in this book.\nHopefully, these examples already suggest that there is something \nimpure about the anti-computational, something incommensurate \nabout the various scales at which it operates, and something partial \nand rarely complete. This impurity interests me and is partly why \nI have not set out to research the most obvious cases. I am interested \nin interventions, often now largely forgotten, aired in very different \nsites, all of which took forms that, even if they were staged by \nacademics, reached beyond the spheres of the academy as these \nlatter are narrowly conceived of, and certainly beyond critical theory \nas an entirely contained project sufficient unto itself. Rather, anti-\ncomputing constellations, which entail an engagement with theory, \nare considered as they emerge in real-world contexts. The attempt \nis to produce critically informed rich descriptions. A series of events, \nwritings, moments, that cross between theoretical and everyday \nregisters, and that are not often explored for what they say about \nthe computational, are reopened and explored as anti-computational, \nand explored through the optic this taxonomic division provides. \nThis close-up view, somewhat set aside in the rest of this opening \nchapter, or at least not referred to in specific terms, constitutes the \nbulk of the work undertaken.\nAnti-computing and its travels\nThe second concern of this book is to explore what connects appar-\nently discrete moments of anti-computing that irrupt in response to \nthe new. It should already be clear that the objects, assemblages, \nmovements, writings, that constitute anti-computing are markedly \nheterogeneous, a term that, as Fredric Jameson notes, has had \nspectacular success in late capitalism (Jameson, 2015). Even in this \nheterogeneity, however, specific iterations of the anti-computational \nare often regarded as disjunct from one another and their connection \nto earlier forms often not recognized; it tends to be ‘new’ dangers, \n‘new’ forms of sociality, ‘new’ kinds of addiction, ‘new’ kinds of \nAI that are feared or disliked, after all. This suggests that discontinuity \nwins out. On the other hand, there are also connections to be identified \n14 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nand explored. Anti-computing is multifaceted and diverse in its \nmateriality, orientation, and scale, unexpected in its forms, unique \nin its instantiations, but it does exhibit forms of coherence, and \nexhibits traits held in common. Moreover, although the times of its \nemergence cannot be predicted, that forms of anti-computing will \nemerge and re-emerge over time can be anticipated, at the very least.\nThus, whilst discrete forms and moments of anti-computing are \nexplored for their intrinsic interest, the question also tackled here \nis how to understand anti-computing as a formation that regenerates, \ntakes up, takes on, moves on, and revives in various recurring forms \nacross time, in irregular but nonetheless recurring circuits. How do \nthese forms travel, how do they translate, come to be rematerialized? \nDoes anti-computing itself, as a formation, have a form of coherence \nover time? Is there a way of doing technological history that can \nencourage recognition of this coherence? This last begins to ask \nquestions about technology and history, and will return us, in Chapter \n2, to an engagement with media archaeology. Briefly prefiguring \nthat here, my argument is that a conditional and partial continuity, \ncomplementing the inaugural moments of new forms of computational \ndissent and confounding what might have appeared to be the terminal \ndisappearance of some others, constitutes one of the defining dynamics \nof anti-computing. The question, then, is how to identify and account \nfor discontinuity/continuity, to explore what appears to be – and \nwhat is – durable in the relationship between computers and the \n(techno)cultures they intervene into.\nThis proposition, constituting the second focus of the book and \nsupplementing the concentration on discrete moments, also begins \nto redefine the anti-computational itself, since the latter becomes \nrecognizable in part as exhibiting a kind of discontinuous continuity. \nHere work by the historian Valerie Traub, seeking to understand \nhistorical recurrence as well as synchronic emergence, has been \nfound insightful. Exploring the periodic rematerialization of various \nbodily tropes across long stretches of human history, Traub sets out \nto understand how various perennial logics and definitions remain \nuseful, across time ‘emerging at certain moments, silently disappearing \nfrom view, and then re-emerging as particularly relevant (or explo-\nsively volatile)’. As Traub sees it, such ‘recurrent explanatory logics \n… are subject to change’, but also ‘evidence a form of persistence’ \n(Traub, 2007: 126). Older tropes, apparently consigned to history, \n Anti-computing: a provisional taxonomy  15\nmay come back to life to ‘trespass’ on the new. Anti-computing may \nbe explored, at least initially, in terms of these dynamics. That is, \nit can be viewed as a series of perennial logics, operating within the \nhorizon of the computational, or of computationally influenced times, \nand disrupting them. Within this time frame, which is massively \ncompressed compared to the long historical periods with which \nTraub is concerned, forms of anti-computing emerge and find force \nand purchase through various modes of materialization, and then \nfade in ‘relevance’ before possibly reviving and returning. These \noscillating circuits or, borrowing from Traub once again, these ‘cycles \nof salience’ (Traub, 2007: 126, 133), are irregular and partial, and \nnew irruptions always contain the discontinuous, as it were. However, \nin the sense that the return is likely to come, the anti-computational \nmoment can be characterized as erratically predictable.\nAn initial taxonomy of the anti-computational\nAnti-computing exists and is found operating in the world; this is \nthe burden of the preceding section. Anti-computing, as I define \nand use it, is however, not only a real-world formation but also a \nmethodology, a working thesis, and an investigatory heuristic. It is \nto be developed as a critical methodology or a ‘working concept’ \n(Foucault, 1972: 9) and the taxonomic operations set out below \nbegin that task. They suggest commonalities, isolate matters of \ninterest, and expose or suggest connections across time, location, \nand register. The task is to identify a series of initial taxonomies, \nidentifying contingently stable and recurring logics or tropes of \nanti-computing.\nConsistent with this, these categories have been constructed in \nresponse to what is found ‘in the wild’ (how popular culture might \ngroup various elements), in response to what my investigations of \nparticular anti-computing moments across the decades suggest, and \nbecause particular principles of grouping might offer insight into \nhow the formations under investigation can be understood. What \nresults – some possible working taxonomies – are then themselves \nset to work, the taxonomic being recognized as a mode of categoriza-\ntion that is both descriptive and operational, a suggestive model \nwith some performative force, rather than anything that will be \n16 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nfully realized. It becomes a means through which to consider rising \nforms of anti-computing, to ask how they are continuous and \ndiscontinuous with what has come before (as is further explored in \nthe final chapter).\nPolarities/binaries\nTaxonomies may be built, or found in operation. Either way, they \nimply the finding or the identification of a pre-existing order – but \nare themselves a powerful ordering process, constituting a mode  \nof interested (non-innocent) knowledge production. As Foucault \nfamously taught us, or, rather, Borges did, social and other taxonomies \nmay tame the wild profusion of things by the imposition of categories \n– which may be apparently incommensurate with each other, or \nwhich may overlap in various ways (Foucault, 1972, Borges, 2000). \nMoreover, the designation of categories may become the subject of \ncontestation, or be part of a political struggle, a demand, as Foucault \nput in an article exploring critique, not to be governed ‘like that’ \n(Foucault, 1997).\nBuilding an anti-computing taxonomy, it seems logical to begin \nby identifying a naturalized or dominant taxonomy of anti-computing, \ninforming much debate around the computational in public culture \nbut also found in theoretical writing, the chief characteristic of \nwhich is a blunt binary division. This organizes hostility to the \ncomputational into two categories, dividing hostility to computers \narising ‘because computers are particular kinds of machines’ from \nhostility arising ‘because human societies are ordered in particular \nkinds of ways’. The first category concerns computer power, and \nthe second the amplification of systems of human domination through \nthe use of control technologies.\nThe first category is essentially ontological. Something intrinsic \nto computers, the computational in essence, taken variously as \ninstrumental, indifferent, in-organic, in control, or simply as ‘alien’ \n(see Weizenbaum, 1976), provokes fears, anxieties, hostilities, and \ndissent. These fears expand as computational cultures themselves \nexpand into new zones. The invocation of a familiar meta-discourse \nfrom within this category constructs or produces an equally familiar \n Anti-computing: a provisional taxonomy  17\nmachine; this is ‘the computer’ that stands against ‘us’ humans \nbecause it threatens to control us. It is why, as the technologist Bill \nJoy put it about AI back in the 1990s, we should be very afraid of \nthe future (Joy, 2000); the same message is now being repeated \naround AI singularity issues.\nThe second category, the ‘wrong hands’ category, is centrally \nconcerned with political economy and human determinants. Its central \nconcern is with what those in power can do with computers, and \nwho those in power will be, or are – by virtue of that character of the \ncomputational (what Winner called political technology). It fears that \nthose who control computer systems use them to accelerate control \nover the ‘rest of us’. This category attaches itself firmly to computing, \nbut we also see earlier iterations in other media technological forms. \nConsider Orwell’s 1984, where the evil media was television, or \nrather the all-seeing telescreen zooming state violence – and, by the \nway, fitness classes – into the homes of citizens.\nWorking with this categorical division, two distinctly different \nways to account for the recurrence of forms of the anti-computational \narise. In the first case a certain ontological consistency is presumed – \ncomputers continue to provoke a particular kind of hostile response \nbecause of what they are and continue to be. The second category \nopens the way to account for the recurrence of certain forms of \nhostility to emerging forms of the computational in social terms – \nfor instance, via the argument that the society that has produced \ncomputers is itself, in a fundamental way, static, operating with \nconsistent social logics or taking the same structural forms; that the \nsame threats and problems with the computational, which are really \n‘problems with society’, continue to irrupt is, then, not surprising.\nThis polarized tale, this binary division between computer ontology \nand social organization, has wide purchase. It emerges in popular \ndiscussions of technology and culture and finds echoes surprisingly \noften in techno-cultural theory and critique. It is powerful, operating \nas what Erkki Huhtamo (1997) might call a topos, or leading meta-\nphor, in discussions of computer and society. Ultimately, however, \nthese are false dichotomies and explanations that work with this \nmodel to account for the anti-computational. To push this somewhat, \nmy claim is that sustaining absolute divisions between the ontological \nand the politically economic, here articulated as a division between \n18 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nwhat computers might do to ‘us humans’ by virtue of their ontology, \nand what (bad) uses humans (or human societal organizations \npeculiarly stripped of their material supports) might put computers \nto, is to support the unsustainable – in theory (where it produces \na distorted account) and in practice or operation (where it operates \nideologically).\nTo ask the (apparently) social question ‘What it is about the \nsocial systems within which computers have arisen that provokes \nthe return of hostile responses to the computational?’ is immediately \nto provoke questions about the distinction between technology and \nsociety, to ask how the constitutive role of the computational within \na social system can be understood. Langdon Winner’s sense of \ntechnology as a political actor (Winner, 1985) would be the critical \ncorrelative here. The powerful ideological force of this binary taxo-\nnomic division should not be set aside. It is what lets actors such \nas Mark Zuckerberg claim it’s culture, not technology, that produces \nplatform violence. It is also what lets governments that have instanti-\nated anti-Islamic policies and encouraged racial hatred insist that \nit’s the (social media platform) technology, not the governmental \npolicies, the social media gurus, nor the politicians, who are at fault \nfor fundamentalism (which is not to say they are innocent either). \nHowever, I also want to insist that even as this division is found in \npractice, it is also in practice where this taxonomy can be seen to \nbreak down. There is rarely, if ever, a purely ontological basis upon \nwhich hostility to the computational arises, and no purely social \nbasis either, once it is accepted that the social is techno-social. The \ninteraction between materials and their constitution, and social \nstructures and their operation in specific historical and located \ncontexts, is misrecognized in this binary taxonomy, its purchase \nnotwithstanding. Anti-computing, we might say, always has coeval \nmotivations. Elaborating a useful taxonomy of anti-computing thus \nmeans recognizing as extant, but also rejecting as a naturalized \ndivision, and therefore rejecting as an appropriate tool for analysis, \nthat binary division between categories of anti-computing that divide \npolitical and ontological factors.\nProviding a better starting point to think about anti-computing \nand its characteristic forms demands keeping in play ontological \nand social factors of the computational, looking at durable and \ninaugural elements of each, and exploring their tensioned relationship \n Anti-computing: a provisional taxonomy 19\nin operation. For instance, to understand the relationship between/\ndifference between hostility to database expansion in the UK in the \n1970s, in the late 1990s, and hostility today, two sets of continui -\nties and disjunctions need to be taken into account. Computation \ntook very different forms at each of these periods, but material \nconsistencies, the digital in this case, remain (this might be a matter \nof computational ontology); this is the first disjunction and continuity \nset, as it were. Second, what is required to build a useful taxonomy \nis both recognition of the specificity of the political climate of any \nrelevant period in computing’s social history and acknowledge -\nment of underlying consistencies within the social order across this \nperiod – capitalism persists, albeit it in remodelled forms, and its \nlogics are dominant. The principles informing this example are now \ntaken up and contribute to the elaboration of a new taxonomy of \nanti-computing which sets out to crosscut and disrupt the binary \nlogics of the first taxonomy whilst also recognizing its framing  \npower.\nA general taxonomy: eight forms of anti-computing\nThe new ordering now set out is composed of eight categories, \nconstituting a provisional taxonomy of the anti-computational, an \nanti-computational catalogue. It is generated through consideration \nof extant instances and/or recurring examples of anti-computing \nacross some decades. New forms of the anti-computational may \nfind their place in this general order, deform or stretch it and thereby \nremake it, or constitute a global challenge to it.\nAnti-computing (i): computer technology as  \ncontrol technology\nComputers are control technologies. This category responds to \nthat. It concerns itself both with computer autonomy and threats to \nhuman autonomy. Asking ‘who is in control – humans or machines?’, \nit fears that the answer to this is that computers themselves are \n‘out of control’. But it also includes, and on an equal footing, \nconcerns around the social order and questions of social control, \npower, and domination. Merging ontology and political binaries, it \n20 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nencompasses existential and political concerns. It fears the capacity \nof computers to deliver totalizing power to the state and to the \nmarket, cementing existing authority and power by ceding control \nof computational resources and foreclosing the open horizons of \nthe future. Left critiques of technocratic rationality come into this \ncategory, for instance those reaching back to the later Frankfurt \nSchool (Marcuse in particular), but so do conservative variants of \nanti-computing, those who fear ‘the computational’ as that which \nwill undermine the existing order of things where that order is \nregarded as just, fair, or simply desirable according to the situated \nposition of those defending it. Hostility to groups who assert their \ncounter-authority and threaten ‘law and order’ through computer \nuse and appropriation often evidence this kind of anti-computing  \nimpulse.\nAnti-computing (ii): computers becoming more lively\nThis form of anti-computing responds to fears concerning the displace-\nment, and ultimately the replacement, of ‘the human’ by ‘the machine’. \nCentral concerns include the rise of computer intelligence and the \nextension of various forms of computer-delivered automation. The \nexistential variant of this category fears that humans have no place \nin the future, since the advent of advanced forms of AI will mean \nthe replacement of humans, either by their machinic successors or \nby future humans sufficiently different from us to be unrecognizable \nas humans. A less elevated set of concerns and anxieties, also coming \nunder this heading, coalesce around issues of replacement as they \npertain to labour and work: white-collar unemployment through \naugmented intelligence of computers, service sector and other labour \nreplaced through the extended reach of computers into areas tradition-\nally regarded as human specialisms because they entail particular \nforms of emotional intelligence or human imagination are key – home \nrobots taking on care, teaching robots undertaking education, for \ninstance. Many of these concerns are captured as fears around the \nautomation of expertise or the replacing of human expertise with \ncomputational expertise in new areas. Anxieties around the displace-\nment of the body, in relation to the bio-digital – for instance, the \never-closer coupling between humans and their devices (partial \ncyborgization) – can also be fitted in here.\n Anti-computing: a provisional taxonomy 21\nAnti-computing (iii): computerization and the hollowing-out \nof everyday life and social interaction\nThis category captures anxieties that arise around the computational \ntransformation of the everyday world, of social interactions, and \nof everyday life and the ways in which it can be lived. They focus \non the surveilled self and life, platform sociality, the hollowing-out \nof social interactions through their automation, felt perhaps in spatial \nand temporal terms (slow movements respond to this phenomenologi-\ncal threat), and on the loss of bodily richness and the pleasures of \nthe informing sensibility of a located physical embodiment. They \nalso concern the lack of depth of new forms of everyday life that \ndistributed and virtualized interactions are felt to produce. Concerns \nabout the attenuation of attention – the continuously disrupted life \n– also fit in here. Latterly, digital detox camps and other refusal \nprogrammes respond directly to these concerns.\nAnti-computing (iv): computer technologies and the threat to \nhuman culture\nIssues captured and grouped here include hostility concerning the \nrise of computational culture and the perceived threat to older \ncultural forms: narrative versus database structures, the logic of \ncode versus the emotional intelligence of the human, the game over \nthe story, graphic principles over aesthetics, data visualization over \nhuman art production, virtualization over materialization, mobile \nscreens versus cinematic projection. One strong version of this says \ncomputerization debases culture even as/or even if it expands the \nlatter’s sphere of action/operation, or that it enables the comple -\ntion of the project of technocratic rationality delivered as a whole \nway of life (the computational culture industries). Adding an ‘s’ \nhere to pluralize human cultures and recognize difference is also \nimportant. Doing so identifies a related but distinctly different set \nof concerns: that the computational reinvigorates a form of binary \nthinking and calculation that standardizes and universalizes, so that \nthe threats responded to here are of computer-assisted standardiza-\ntion, conformity, and non-situated universalism. Concerns around \nAI and bias find a place here. Finally, there is a strand of anxiety \naround computational engagements with the humanities and the arts \n22 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nwhich fears the replacement of human creativity with computational  \ninstrumentality.\nAnti-computing (v): the general  \naccident/catastrophe theory\nThis category groups concerns that neither computers nor humans \ncontrol the outcomes of increasingly complex processes that computers \nundertake, particularly in relation to biotech but also in relation to \nnetwork complexity, neural networks, emergence, AI. The fear is \nthat these developments make the more or less accidental emergence \nof catastrophic outcomes drastically at odds with the programs’ (or \nprogrammers’) original intentions more likely to come about. Relating \nto cultural theorist Paul Virilio’s (1997) theory of the ‘general accident’ \nand Beck’s (1992) discussion of the ‘risk society’, this kind of anti-\ncomputing often emerges as a response to genomics and environmental \nissues, but also in relation to neural networks, AI agency, and \nalgorithmic bias. It is invoked in more partial ways in many other \nspheres – program trading and market crashes are good examples. \nOnce again, existential fears emerge but here tend to focus on the \nfate of the environment rather than, or as well as, foregrounding \nthe future of the human.\nAnti-computing (vi): horrible humans\nThis form of anti-computing doesn’t ‘blame’ computers for the \nwrongs it discerns. Rather, it excoriates humans for taking advantage \nof what computers increasingly enable humans to ‘get away with’. \nEssentially illiberal, it says that the anti-social grounds of the machine, \nthe distancing from real accountability that pervasive networks and \nthe platforms provide, undermine collective moral responsibility \nand social norms that other social forms policed. The computer is \nnot only a mirror to ourselves through which we see ourselves \nclearly and do not like what we see, it also enables or ‘encourages’ \nforms of action that humans would not previously have undertaken; \n‘because they are there’, ‘because I can’, ‘because I can’t be seen’. \nComputers are disliked because they come close to enabling (what \nis viewed as) a nascent human degeneracy.\n Anti-computing: a provisional taxonomy  23\nAnti-computing (vii): standardization/quantification\nThis gathers together a cluster of hostilities and anxieties coalescing \naround epistemology. Computer operations are framed as determinate \nand reductive, and it is feared their expansion will produce a world \norganized according to ‘alien’ logics. This includes concerns that \ncomputing will render the world into quantifiable chunks so that \nit may be indifferently operated upon. ‘Solutions’ will triumph over \n‘theory’ in the sciences and the arts (Anderson, 2008), quantification \nover qualitative judgement and hermeneutics, and the imposition \nof standardization, uniformity, and the ironing out of exception will \ntriumph over variation, difference, and human judgement. This \ncategory operates in relation to, for instance, forms of knowledge \nproduction, computationally derived managerialism, bureaucratically \nled thinking. A criterion focused on knowledge issues, it also entails \na concern about human ethics and their overruling or bypassing.\nAnti-computing (viii): too much information\nThis category captures concerns over information overload, but also \nincludes anxieties about the fetishization of information capture, \nthe fetishism of ‘facts’, the overproduction of information – whether \nas data, text, image, and the prioritization of production and circula-\ntion over interpretation. This category of anti-computing is one of \nthe most long standing. It finds new articulations around big data. \nIts obvious connections to other categories make it clear that the \ndivisions between these clusters are not fixed or impervious.\nThis initial taxonomy is informed by a close engagement with a \nseries of forms of anti-computational thinking over time. However, \nit does not reflect a robust, data-driven investigation. It is incom-\nplete and can be disputed. Some people I have shown this to have \nsuggested another one or two (or more) categories – although no \nalternative mapping provided a more total ‘solution’, nor even a \nmore complete map. It is necessarily provisional. It responds to \ndifferent methodological approaches to material studied, it accepts \nthe hybrid, it assumes crossovers will continue to occur, and that \nthe power and force of vectors linking the various categories will \nchange over time and may rewrite the whole. For these reasons, \n24 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nrather than despite them, it is a substantial improvement over the \nbinary division already discussed, and not only because each category \ncan encompass ontologically directed criticisms and those that relate \nto instantiated technologies within specific political economies. It \nenables an exploration of anti-computing, its temporality, character, \nrarity, and the forms it takes across time, that begins by assuming \na complex relationship between the ontological properties of the \ntechnologies entailed in computational intervention and the horizons \nof social power and particular forms of social system (capitalism, \nlate capitalism, neoliberalism) within which these operate, of which \nthey are part.\nThe emotional register?\nThere are other registers that could be used to further elaborate a \ntaxonomy of anti-computing, perhaps to produce a taxonomic series. \nThe sort could be by results (effective or ineffective campaigns), genre \n(theoretical writing, public campaign, popular or public opinion, \nlegal response), material (documents, campaigns, technologies), or \nalong various time lines that might impose forms of periodization \n(anti-computing before personal computers, without wires, including \nmobile devices, after 9/11, before mini-computing, after the dot.\ncom crash, since Web 2.0, and so forth. And there is always the \nemperor’s robot dog …). I am not pursuing most of these here, in \npart because they tend to divide where I wish to join – for instance, I \nwant to trespass between, rather than to demarcate, critical theoretical \nand other forms of anti-computing, and I am interested in how \nhostility travels through rather than defines an era, or is defined by \nit. There are, however, some alternative taxonomies that intersect \nin productive ways with the one set out above. The first, set out \nhere in Figure 1, albeit in skeletal form, organizes anti-computing \nby emotional register.\nThis ordering crosscuts the earlier eight-part taxonomic catalogue, \nas is evidenced in specific ways in some of the later chapters – for \ninstance, in relation to revelation, revisionism, and expert witnessing \nin the case of a computer science insider who becomes a hostile \nwitness (Chapter 6); anger in the case of F.R. Leavis, the unlikely \nsubject of Chapter 5; or in relation to joy when the protagonist of \n Anti-computing: a provisional taxonomy  25\na singularity novel celebrates embodiment over AI minds in Chapter \n7. This list is suggestive, and again certainly not complete; perhaps \nno emotional mapping can be otherwise. It is also potentially mislead-\ning – at least, if it suggests that anti-computing can be comprehended \nprimarily as an individually felt emotional response or as an individual \nresponse per se. What I am trying to capture, even when working \nwith or through individual responses or stories, are forms of collective \nand ambient unease, the collective sensibilities, perhaps the minor-key \nstructures of feeling, often as they are gathered up and expressed \nthrough a single example, or by an individual, that constitute anti-\ncomputing as a material social formation, articulated on multiple \nplatforms and through many materials, within a dominant culture \nthat is generally positive or accepting, or fatalistic about computa-\ntional ‘advance’.\nIt’s clear that an obverse list of categories, one that does not work \nthrough emotions but, rather, deals with categories concerning reason, \nmight also be generated; anti-computing may be categorized variously \nas rational, thought through, analytic, deliberative, irrational, for \nFigure 1 An affective taxonomy of anti-computing\nAcknowledged fatalism \nAnger \nAnxiety \nBoredom \nCensoriousness\nConcern \nCritique \nDisillusion\nFear\nFrustration\nHatred\nHostility \nRefusal \nRevolt\nUnease\nRevelation  \nJouissance/joy\n26 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\ninstance. These cuts, however, rather easily fall into binaries (rational/\naffective, reason/emotion), again tending to stress division where I \nwish to notice joins.\nA taxonomy of anti-computing computing?\nA further alternative or complementary taxonomy could be built \nspecifically around (or perhaps could be restricted to) materials. \nThis would include those forms of computing (following N. Katherine \nHayles and others and taking computing as undertaken both by \nhumans and machines) that might be regarded as, or exploited to \nforward the goals of, anti-computing: glitches for instance, varieties \nof hacking, simple machine breaking, could be included in a broad \nspectrum anti-computational mapping. It would also be possible to \ncategorize anti-computing in terms of the forms of technology or \nmaterial or matter that ‘resist’ the computational (vinyl, shellac, \npaper, ink, for instance), or as a collection of forms of cultural acts \nor practices that in their materiality or form frustrate the compu-\ntational; symbolic language with its ambiguity, the codes of the \nunspoken or unsaid, that which is only implied, glossolalia, face \nmasks designed to disrupt face recognition, such as those developed \nby Zac Blas, for instance (Blas, 2012–14, Bassett, 2013). Some of \nthese forms are discussed in later chapters. These groupings, whilst \nsuggestive, are not pursued further here, but they do inform the \nwhole. They might be seen to crosshatch the main grouping.\nCategorizing critical approaches?\nAnti-computing is heterogeneous in mode of address and form; \nnotably, it is neither solely an intellectual formation nor solely a \npopular one. Various theoretical orientations, more or less directly \nengaging with anti-computing, might be permed out and captured \nunder another set of headings (Figure 2).\nThese critical and theoretical orientations inform the eight-part \ntaxonomic mapping and feature in it, but not neatly, often appearing \nin more than one place. That is, my general taxonomy certainly does \nnot reduce to categories informed by these theoretical orientations, \n Anti-computing: a provisional taxonomy  27\nindeed it complicates them. All these other groupings, lists joined \nby what Bogost (2012) called the ‘gentle knot’ of the comma, can \nbe unjoined and redistributed across all of the eight categories of \nmy overarching taxonomy, where they will not sit still and do not \nfit neatly. They loosen it up, let it breathe, perhaps tend to let it \nbegin to transform; the taxonomy after all is both a catalogue and \na list, and the latter demands endless and ongoing elaboration. \nAs Georges Perec, a theorist of everyday life and a lover of the \nautomated sort, noted:\n[N]othing seems simpler than making a list, but in fact it’s much more \ncomplicated than it seems: you always leave something out, you’re \ntempted to write etc., but the whole point of an inventory is not to \nwrite etc. (Perec, 2009)\nCritical orientations and situations\nI now briefly turn to reflect on my own situated position – and my \nown take on the computational. My intention has been to develop a \ncultural study of and with anti-computing that is orientated by broadly \nhistorical materialist approaches and that substantially engages with \nmedia archaeology and medium theory. This general outlook produces \ncertain starting points. Notably it generates an account framed in \nmaterial and materialist terms, cognisant of overarching social and \ntechno-social logics, understood or explored in their diachronic as \nwell as synchronic aspects; the complex temporalities and continuities \nFigure 2 A taxonomy of theoretical positions\nTechnocratic rationality \nReactionary modernism\nDefence of humanism/anti or post-humanism\nPrimitivism \nDefence of tradition\nTheological objections \nUnintended consequences\nComputers as political technology\nMoral objections  \n28 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nand disjunctures of the computational/anti-computational demand \nthis. Technology, recognized in its materiality, is always also explored \nin relation to culture, and in relation to social power; that is to say, \nby a critical theorization of technology and culture that sees the two \nas co-evolving. This general theoretical/critical approach does not \ndemand or entail either a sustained rejection of the technological, or \nits vehement adoption. Finding a reconfigured role for technology in \nthe generation of new forms of future possibility – which might stand \nagainst the expectations of progress – is certainly not a matter of \nquantity, more of this stuff or less or that. However, I recognize that \nwhere I write from does have consequences. I have more sympathy \nwith some of the anti-computing formations I explore than with \nothers, and perhaps also read their significance differently.\nThis account turns around shards and fragments of computational \nculture, involving therefore a series of decisions about what to pick \nup and what to leave on the ground. For instance, thinking about \nquestions of technologies and bodies, I selected as one object of \ninquiry the science fiction (SF) writing of Hanu Rajaniemi, read as \na defence of embodiment over anti-human uploading fantasies, \nchoosing to explore this rather than – say – concentrating on a \ndiscussion of the moral economy of the games-censorship lobby in \nthe UK in the 1990s; Either of these could find a place in the kind \nof expanded taxonomy of anti-computing under development here. \nTo me, the first seems to provide a more intriguing way of thinking \nthrough unease around ‘artificial’ bodies and practices than the \nsecond. Similarly, whilst much public attention is being paid to \nissues falling within the category I designate ‘horrible humans’ – \ncyber-terror, internet pornography, shaming are often accounted for \ncurrently in terms of the unleashing of the inhuman in the human, \nof letting beasts not gods into the machine – this has not been \nexplicitly addressed through a case study; rather, I return to it in \nthe concluding chapter to ask why and how it has exploded as an \noperative category and why, as a categorizing operation, it has \nbecome so pervasive and so effective in ascribing blame. Other \nshards were more demanding of attention.\nAm I anti-computing? I have elsewhere considered the possibili -\nties of silence and refusal and have certainly critiqued particular \ncomputational formations in terms of their neoliberal instantiation, \namongst other things (Bassett, 2007, 2013, Bassett and Roberts, \n Anti-computing: a provisional taxonomy  29\n2020). However, against the writing on the computational framed \nin terms of refusal that I have produced, I would set other work \nthat articulates a conviction that there are other forms of the \ncomputational than those that dominate today, and that these are \nimportant, significant, creative, affirmative, live giving, and can be \nused as tools for justice. So, I am not declaring for anti-computing. \nAnd this is not a manifesto. Nor is it a call for de-acceleration, \nfor a go-slow, and certainly it is not a call for revived forms of \nprimitivism. On the other hand, an anti-computing impulse of a \nkind chimes with my desire to upset an established form of thinking \nabout technological innovation, precisely the teleological progress \nnarrative already outlined above, and to protest the multiple ways \nit is put to ideological use. Anti-computing opens a way to think \ncritically about the claims and instantiations of the computational, \nand as part of this I seek to think about the discrete formations \nI explore in critical terms. So, if this is not a manifesto, it is, as \nBarad would put it, a cut (Barad, 2003). And I am intending to  \ncut in.\nTo attempt a summation of the issues opened up here, which \nstand as a rationale for what is to come, and which also set out my \nown position, I close this chapter by suggesting that anti-computing \nis useful to develop and explore for six connected reasons.\n• Hostility to the computational is a significant strand in the fabric  \nof human–computer engagement as that tissue has developed \nover seventy years. It is a strand that is largely ignored in histories, \nand certainly rarely viewed as something systematic. It is worthy \nof attention because of this. It offers a different perspective on, \nand suggests other ways to gauge the implications and claims \nof, computational ‘advancement’. Anti-computing might be, \nsomewhat in the manner of counter-factual history, deployed \nto raise the possibility of other possibilities.\n• Anti-computing moments are part of the history of computing \nas a material cultural history and are worth excavating, in and \nof themselves.\n• Anti-computing formations are at times strident and gain much  \npopular acceptance. But they are also, measured against the \noverwhelming tide of acceptance of the computational insertion \ninto everyday life, relatively uncommon …\n30 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\n• … But although there has never been a grand movement, an \noverarching narrative of computational dissent, nor a single \ndefining moment that has persisted, various arguments recur, \nrepeating and also mutating in each iteration. These circuits, \ngiving insight into processes and forms of intersection between \nmaterial cultures and their histories and social and political \ndevelopments over time, demand further investigation.\n• Exploring anti-computing can contribute to developing ways of  \ncritically understanding media-technological histories – which \nI read as asking questions about the intersection of questions \nconcerning computational technologies, culture, and power.\n• Anti-computing formations do not necessarily set out to directly  \nchallenge the power structures within which they are embedded; \ntheir orientations are varied. But exploring anti-computing \nformations can expose the ideological power and force of author-\nized versions of computational ‘advancement’ that constitute \nthe dominant computational imaginary. The anti-computational \nturn which I make in this book therefore has critical intent.\nNotes\n1 The Luddites’ rational, if impassioned, arguments against the use of \nmachines as political tools by another class, expressed as machine breaking \n(and had not that other class also ‘spoken’ through those same machines?), \nwere supposed to be senseless.\n2 Some confirmation of this comes via Google’ s Ngram, which shows the \nterm peaking in the year 2000 (time span 1980–2015).\nBibliography\nAnderson, Chris. 2008. ‘The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the \nScientific Method Obsolete’, Wired, 16 July, http://archive.wired.com/\nscience/discoveries/magazine/16–07/pb_theory.\nAndrejevic, Mark. 2015. ‘The Droning of Experience’, The Fibreculture \nJournal 187, http://twentyfive.fibreculturejournal.org/fcj-187-the-droning- \nof-experience/\nArendt, Hannah. 1998 [1958].

It is these problems \nthat will be studied here. (Foucault, 1972: 21)\nWhat began as a cultural and medium-theoretic study roving across \na series of sites increasingly involved engagement with issues of \ncomputer history; this came to seem essential to understanding and \nconstructing anti-computing. But why look back? Following the turn \nof the decade, as I complete this book, there is abundant hostility to \ncomputing, anxiety about its impacts, and rejection of its visions in \nthe here and now. Automation anxieties around the future of work are \nfuelling a new anti-computational turn, data-surveillance issues haunt \nformal politics, and there is rising concern over screen ‘addiction’ in \nthe young. Limit points are being declared and last-chance saloons \nannounced. The massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand in 2019, \nstreamed live for a cruelly long time and endlessly disseminated, \nseemed to many to at once exemplify everything wrong with the \nplatforms – deemed uncaring, unable to control what they unleashed, \nand not choosing to do so since their end goal is profit, not social \nwell-being; and to point to everything wrong with digital humans, \nwhose capacity to share ugliness and to share extremism appears \nto expand in tandem with the expansion of the means to do so. \nSince then, not much has changed, although that event has receded \nfrom consciousness – unconscionably quickly, perhaps. So, why \nnot stay in the here and now and explore contemporary hostility? \nMy response is that to remain entirely within the present and/or \nwithin near future horizons (real and imaginary) risks succumbing \nto forms of presentism prevalent both within the computational \n Discontinuous continuity  35\nmainstream and within many of the anti-computational formations \ninvestigated here. These forms of presentism are questioned in  \nthis book.\nSo, as well as being a cultural study, this book is a cultural history, \nalbeit of a discontinuous kind. The hope is that historical inquiry \nre-energizes explorations of the contemporary condition because it \noffers a route through which to examine the ‘plastic’ (Uprichard, \n2013) forms of presentism that many have identified as part of the \ncurrent ‘conjuncture’ or moment (e.g. Liu, 2004, Jameson, 2015). \nPresentism, explored further below, is a key element of computational \ncapitalism. It has consequences for theorizing and understanding \nanti-computing. An exclusive focus on the present renders hostile \nresponses to the computational into discrete and proximate issues \n(problems with this kind of corporation or this kind of architecture, \nthis new technology or that new behaviour, horrified responses to this \nkind of screening, or that kind of digitally mediated hatred) cutting \nthem off from larger, overarching formations and short-circuiting \nlonger, more complex histories of refusal, critique, unease, anxiety, \nand activity.\nConsider three sets of more or less hostile responses to the \ncomputational that have circulated in the decade since 2010, grouped \ntogether here because each declares that what it excoriates is novel. \nThe first of these groupings is anti-platform, and increasingly anti-\nmonopoly; it finds a key role for social media platforms in the crisis \nof democracy represented by Trump, and Brexit and its aftermath, \nlocating this in the capacity of platforms to host and promote \nextremism and to enable fake news (the New Zealand case exhibits \nthese logics). The second form of dissent, markedly critical of how \ncomputers are being used by nation-states, and of what they are \nbeing used to do to ordinary people, circulates in the post-Snowden \nera and is concerned with personal data in an era of ‘Big Data’ – the \nlatter a label that itself makes claims about novelty. A third response \nis the postdigital analysis (Cramer, 2014). This assesses the state of \nthe digital itself and is in this sense a meta-analysis. It is above all \njaded and ‘disenchanted’ (Couldry, 2014, Bassett, 2015). It says \nthat the digital, now instantiated as a pervasive material of the \neveryday, has lost its purchase as a defining cultural logic; it continues, \nand yet it is no longer really new or interesting, nor does it open \nnew horizons. This has sometimes produced an aesthetics challenging \n36 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\ninvisibility and/or the normalization of pervasive mediation – Hito \nSteyerl’s (2013) work and writing is germane here, but more often \nhas fuelled a turn to a new new attraction. In the case of the \npostdigital there is still a new claim – since what is said to be new \nis the claim to go beyond the prioritizing of the new. As an aesthetic, \nthe postdigital is thus hostile to ‘the digital’.\nThese three examples of anti-computational formations operating \nmore or less in the present are easy to classify as newly arising, and \nare often seen simply as new. But all three also relate to earlier \nirruptions, from which they are now largely delinked. This is not \nexceptional; there are many forms of anti-computing that are not \nentirely new, and that may even be recognizable as familiar, even \nwhilst this ‘familial’ relation is disavowed, set aside, or forgotten. \nExamples might include that falling away of enthusiasm for the \nfully computerized society that led Edmund Berkeley, editor of \nComputers and Automation, one of the first computer magazines, 1 \nto change the title to Computers and People. This is an early example \nof computational disenchantment based on dehumanization concerns, \nbut it is not a formation that tends to be linked with current concerns \naround dehumanization and automation laid at the feet of contem-\nporary AI. Or consider the 2001/2 bursting of the dot.com bubble, \nwhich deflated a form of net euphoria partly by identifying it as an \n(unjustified) euphoria about the new; the postdigital formation, \nclearly linking in to this earlier moment, isn’t entirely novel, even \nif it often presents itself as such.\nThen there are the anti-computing sentiments threading into the \ncounter-cultural movements of the 1960s and centrally concerned \nwith the rise of data and the perfection of the state ‘machine’ (Turner, \n2006). The issues raised around that time have not been resolved, \nalthough neither have the most apocalyptic visions of a fully com-\nputerized world arisen (yet). The critique faded away, or, as the \nother kind of weathermen say of a storm, it lost its identity. Or \nconsider the widespread opposition to the Regulation of Investigatory \nPowers Act in the UK in the early 2000s (John Naughton’s com-\nmentaries in the Observer provide an indicative flavour of this). \nThe investigatory powers legislation, which was passed into law, \nplays its part in contemporary surveillance regimes. The UK has \nsince completed the implementation of what many regard as an \nextension to its terms,2 rather than a simple renewal of some of the \n Discontinuous continuity  37\npowers it legislated for. This has not gone forwards without hostile \ncommentary, but even within that, the widespread opposition, unease, \nand hostility provoked the last time around, substantial in liberal, \nradical and mainstream media and amongst campaign groups, has \nfar more rarely surfaced in public debate. Finally, consider the many \nlate 20th-century campaigns against camera surveillance in public \nspaces in the UK and elsewhere. These were both local and national, \nand evidenced a widespread unease. When did that switch in attitudes \nwhich made it possible to market general surveillance as a necessary, \nif not desirable, part of public space come about?\nThe mismatches of scale and register in these examples are \nintentional. What links them is that they partake in the same logics \nof recurring appearance and disappearance. What might be termed, \nadapting Foucault (1972: 209), the dissolvability of anti-computing \nformations, their propensity to subside and vanish from view, even \nwhilst remaining in the mix, is marked.\nMore examples: who would not find the notion of demanding \nan iron apron to word-process strange today? Iron aprons were a \nunion-based response to early VDUs (visual display units) and to \nconcerns with the health hazards screens might pose to pregnant \nwomen, and although more recent concerns with blue light reca-\npitulate earlier fears about VDUs and eye strain, screen technology \nchanged and the pregnancy concern died away. This indicates how \nolder dissent may be delinked from contemporary issues, deemed \nirrelevant because the specific technologies that provoked them are \n‘out of date’. A different issue is whether the critique of social \nrelations which they entailed becomes irrelevant in relation to suc-\ncessor technologies and the dissent they afford. Here are two examples \nwhere the impetus for earlier hostility fading is less certain: first, \nwhat happened to opposition to Photoshop and digital photography \nfrom those in favour of ‘real’ photography as the guarantor of \nindexical realism and documentary ‘truth’? This was a debate held \nin professional photography circles, amongst other places, in the \n1990s. Clearly, the stakes of this earlier discussion connect to unease \naround deep fakes today; this despite the fact that material indexicality \nis no longer the issue around which debate circulates.3 Second, \nautomated passport gates. Were you against them once? Did you \nview your objections as principled at that time? Many did. Do you \nremember why, or when, you changed your mind, or set aside your \n38 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nobjections? Moreover, assuming your original objections were set \naside, were they set aside for good? Or do they remain somehow \nwith you, might they be refound as a set of responses that might \ninform a response to different modes of surveillance now arising? \nHow does personal acceptance relate to a general hardening of \nborders, to populist nationalisms?\nThese examples indicate the fragility, and even the ephemerality \n(Chun, 2008a), of many forms of computational dissent, which are \nof their moment, and, to some extent, live in it (which is to say \nthey also partake in a form of presentism). But they also evidence \na paradoxical durability, obduracy, and persistence. Even when \napparently terminally discarded because attached to an outmoded \ntechnology, or because attacking an outmoded problem, many anti-\ncomputing formations remain if not immediately ready at hand, \nthen apparently capable of being reached for, invoked, ready to \ninform a new landscape. What is dissolved in, is not necessarily \ndissolved out. One reason, then, to explore anti-computing formations \nacross time is to find a way to avoid being consumed by the force \nof presentism; but another is to register the limits of its operations, \nthe limits of what it may suppress of the past. Walter Benjamin’s \nsense of history as unfinished resonates here, with its argument that \nwhat appears to have been terminally consigned to a dead past, so \nthat its place in history, and its significance, have been settled (and, \nin general, by the victors), may be unsettled, and may become active \nin the present (Benjamin, 2006).\nThis suggests to me two priorities. The first is to refind anti-\ncomputational formations in the past, and the second is to understand \nthe dynamics of their recurrence. I want to draw out and understand \na series of anti-computing formations, and to understand them both \nas discrete and as connected, as formations that, more than is usually \nunderstood, persist across time, and that might rise, fall, and revive, \nin non-linear, complex, and indirect ways.\nThis contrasts with linear accounts of the computational, which \nview it has having risen, apparently inexorably, to become a key \noperational logic in the cultures of late 20th- and 21st-century global \ncapitalism; to have become that which organizes the present and \nthat which constitutes the ‘superhighway’ to the future (the old \n1990s term is apt to describe an ideological orientation, even if it \nnever fitted the reality). This claim (highly ideological) is compromised \n Discontinuous continuity  39\nonce the anti-computational is taken into that account. The trajectories \nand circuits of the anti-computational are at times hardly to seen, \nat others brilliantly lit. They often appear disconnected, or produce \nnodes that seem to have risen autonomously, from nowhere at all, \nor as the direct consequence of something ‘all new’ (AI, automation, \nplatforms, for instance), but they also seem peculiarly familiar, to \nhave recourse to a series of recurrent and pre-existing tropes, or to \nmake connections with earlier sensibilities or formulations. The \ncentral problematic of this chapter is how to identify and account \nfor the forms of disjunctive continuity that characterize anti-computing \nas a material cultural form and that give it its ‘history’.\nDoing ‘computer history’\nThe engagement between information technology and culture central \nto mid- to late 20th-century and early 21st-century life is complex, \noperating at a dizzying series of scales and registers, involving \nheterogeneous actors – humans, technologies, techniques, materials, \nenvironments – bound into multiple overlapping networks, constituted \nand reconstituted over time, in relations of radical and structural \nasymmetry. Computer historian Paul Edwards rightly observes that \nwriting an entire history of computing would be ‘a colossal and \ndifficult task, beyond the reach of any individual’ (Edwards, 2001: \n87). The question, then, is how to make the cut.\nBig stories of computing tend to be prey to a series of occlusions, \noften arising through forms of substitution. 4 Complex formations \nare replaced by abstract technologies, or ‘wizard’ inventors produc-\ning characteristic distortions across a range of technical histories \n(Edwards, 2001: 88). Such distortions arise when key individuals \nare invoked, not to ‘stand for’ or symbolize a larger formation as a \nparticularizing synecdoche (Whitsitt, 2013), but as having themselves \ndetermined the history of a corporation; Steve Jobs has figured in \nthis way, for instance. ‘Great men’ may also be replaced by ‘great \nsoftware’ (Photoshop, for instance), or great algorithms (Google \nsprings to mind). Institutional histories can produce less myopic \naccounts; a successful example is Steven Levy’s history of Apple’s \nearly decades (Levy, 1994), but when institutional psychologism \nreplaces the individual psychologism that informs wizard accounts \n40 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nand that is translated into a form of object agency, other problems \narise. An insistent focus on how a company ‘thinks’ or performs \nits identity easily comes at the expense of what it does (its tech-\nnologies, its relations of production), and even of its real location. \nRelevant here are accounts that neglect the working conditions of the \nindustrial plants of the global South and the repatriated low-wage \nservice centres inside the US in favour of poring over the temple \narchitectures of the giant corporations in Silicon Valley in search of \nthe ‘DNA’ of their owners and the character of what is (only very \npartially) made within their grounds. To read a homogeneous ‘global’ \nnarrative of computerization off from this central dashboard is to \nmisrecognize the significance of the location of material (as well as \nimmaterial) production, the specific experience and use conditions \nof billions of instantiated users, and the complexity of the flow of \ntechnologies, ideas, and workers to and from the dominant hubs. \nIndeed, it renders computer culture ‘Californian’, perhaps leaving \na small space for ‘European’ thought as its mordantly critical \nother, as Richard Barbrook notoriously suggested in the 1990s. \nBarbrook’s analysis, radical in intent, is now striking for what it \nexcludes. Where is the rest of the world here? Another consequence \nof this kind of ordering is a tendency to confine origin stories of \nresistant practices (e.g. hacking) to the same core region, when, as \nKat Braybrooke notes, they have always been more widespread \n(Braybrooke and Jordan, 2017). The same tendency can be observed \nin (congruent) histories of cyber-feminism, always more than Anglo-\nAmerican, Australian or European, but all too often compressed into  \nthat mould.\nMaking the cut: or why social history versus medium specifics \nisn’t good enough\nLisa Gitelman’s rejection of heroic stories of ‘how one technology \nleads to another, or of isolated geniuses working their magic on the \nworld’ (Gitelman, 2006: 7), translates some of these issues into a \nnarrower register – that of media/medium studies. Gitelman argues \nthat technological media demand social and cultural histories. Making \nthis case she is essentially mapping an established ‘media history’ \napproach, critical of populist hero histories but also of what it \n Discontinuous continuity  41\ndiscerns as forms of reductive technological determinism, onto ‘new’ \ndigital media history. Gitelman’s work is representative of a form \nof media history that critiques technological abstraction whilst \ndemonstrating an awareness of medium operations. Another example \nis found in Kate Lacey’s (2013) work on early radio, which fuses \nsound studies with institutional histories. Both scholars help to make \nthe case for demanding (more) recognition of the social and cultural \nconditions of possibility within which digital technologies, and the \npolitical economies they foster, come into being. This general approach \nhas produced important histories of various aspects of the compu-\ntational – for instance, of the role of IBM in the Second World War, \nof cybernetics as Cold War technology, of the technologies of everyday \nlife in the constitution of American society/domestic life in the 1950s, \nof broadcasting institutions such as the BBC and others (see Gerovitch, \n2001, Hendy, 2000, Black, 2011).\nNone of the writing invoked here is entirely social constructivist; \nindeed, most of it might be characterized, following Skågeby and \nRahm’s (2018) useful definition, as post-constructivist. Partly because \nof this, perhaps, it is rarely polemical about the virtues of its own \nmethod. It is nonetheless taken up as a target and used by new \nmaterialist critics of ‘traditional’ media-historical approaches, who \n(by framing it as such), argue that if attention is paid to medium \nmatters, not enough attention is paid. This is felt to produce occlu-\nsions. Gitelman’s rejection of teleological stories is based on her \nsense that ‘media are unique and complicated historical subjects’ \n(Gitelman, 2006: 7), and this complexity is recognized to inhere in \npart in their materiality. But for new materialist critics of ‘traditional’ \nways of doing history this admission of the material may not suffice. \nWhat needs challenging, from their perspective, is that tradition \nwhich holds humans to be the history makers in the final analysis. \nFor various flavours of German medium theory, notably, the condi-\ntions of possibility for agency and the nature of subjectivity itself \nare reconstituted by technical media.\nCuts and lines\nThis suggests a blunt division in the orientation of theoretical work, \nsometimes framed as a division between a focus on materiality or \n42 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\non representation, which needs to be questioned. This might begin \nby acknowledging the distances between, for instance, Leslie Haddon’s \nengagement with domestic histories and gaming in the 20th-century \nUK (Haddon, 1988), Fred Turner’s work on techno-cultures and \nSilicon Valley (Turner, 2006), and Kittler’s essay on ‘Protected Mode’, \na classic of medium history (Kittler, 1997), which are substantial. \nOn the other hand, proclaimed absolute divisions between various \nforms of digital media research made by proponents of one side or \nthe other do not necessarily reflect the opposing view in its complexity, \nnor indeed acknowledge the ambiguity and contradictions of their \nown positions, and may usefully be challenged.\nAnti-computing is part of that challenge. If histories are cuts (and \nmust be cuts, given the impossibility of completeness), then anti-\ncomputing is a cut. It is a cutter too, since with it I want to make \nparticular kinds of incisions, to divide and to bring together. But \ncuts do not have to produce binary polarities. Cuts join, and there \nis always what happens along the line of the cut itself, and in the \nliminal zones around it, where contagion happens. Perhaps, as Ann \nLight suggests in her work on technology and subjectivity, there are \nways of cheating the cut (Light, 2011). Light is drawing on China \nMiéville’s novel The City and the City, in which rival polities overlap \nbut also disavow one another’s existence, producing an impossible \nbut also real separation. The protagonist finds a way out of both \ncities by exploiting or traversing the cut that joins them. ‘I was \nlearning … how to walk between, first in one, then the other, or in \neither … [a] covert equivocation’ (Miéville, 2009: 368). ‘To walk \nbetween’ different conceptions of media history is to challenge \nabsolute divisions, all too often erected, between the social and the \ntechnical, and between ‘media history’, ‘medium studies’, and media \narchaeology. The point is to produce an account that is not reducible \nto technologies presumed to ‘determine’ our situation (Kittler, 1997), \nnor to institutional readings, whilst also disturbing accounts cleaving \nto representation rather than material that flatten the technological \nor render it into discourse. Anti-computing as a cut, a walk-through \nthat gathers what it needs, is to be organized by a reading of the \ncomputational as a process of co-evolution between machines and \nhumans and therefore as intrinsically (in its materialized and operating \nform) techno-social. In what follows this line is walked.\n Discontinuous continuity  43\nArchaeology and media archaeology\nIn the Archaeology of Knowledge Foucault (1972) explores distinc-\ntions between two forms of history. The first is a seeking for origins, \nan anthropological history, that which seeks in history to find \nreassurance of the sovereign subject, which works through this subject \nand presumes their coherence across time, an approach generating \norigins and positing a form of linearity which also indicates teleology. \nThe second form of history is based on rupture and discontinuity. \nChampioning the second form (and binding this to an anti-human \nreading of Marx, to Nietzschean genealogy, and to psychoanalysis, \nall of which are viewed as engaging in the decentring of the human), \nFoucault avowedly sets out not to attack history, but only a certain \nform of history. Moreover, he claims that his intervention is part of \na larger shift, an ‘autochthonous’ transformation in the thinking of \nmany scholars or ‘the eclipse of that form of history … secretly … \nrelated to the synthetic activity of the subject’ (Foucault, 1972: 14). \nOther disciplines, those which ‘evade the work of the historian’, \nare invoked, those which are concerned with rupture, and which \nsearch for ‘displacements’ and ‘transformations’ of concepts. Foucault \nnotes emerging forms of the history of science, particularly those \ninfluenced by Gaston Bachelard, lauding such endeavours as a ‘new \nform of history’ at whose heart is ‘the questioning of the document’ \n(Foucault, 1972: 6).\nFoucault writes that in these conditions (in this time of trans -\nformation) discontinuity demands reassessment. It is no longer a \nproblem, a gap, something to be plugged in(to) a linear account. \nOn the contrary, discontinuity should be focused upon by the \nhistorian, who may now explore ‘the limits of process, the point \nof inflection of a curve, the inversion of a regulatory movement, \nthe boundaries of an oscillation’. Discontinuity becomes ‘an instru-\nment and object of research’ (Foucault, 1972: 9). The distinction \nis between a history that provides for the subject (and renders \nhistory itself as) ‘a place of rest, certainty, reconciliation, a place \nof tranquilized sleep’ (Foucault, 1972: 14) and that new form of \nhistory, founded in rupture and focusing on discontinuity rather \nthan linearity, that Foucault wished to develop. The flat line of the \nlong sleep is to be interrupted. Something is to be jolted into new \n44 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nlife – but vitality will not come from the old sovereign actors. It was \nthe provision of a guaranteed place for them that produced history  \nas sleep.\nObject and instrument; discontinuity is instrumental because it \nis the blade that may shuck out the matter or material documentation \nthat, says Foucault, must be grasped, explored, and worked upon. \nThe goal is no longer to reconstitute ‘on the basis of what the docu-\nments say, and sometimes merely hint at … the past from which \nthey emanate, and which has now disappeared far behind them’. \nDocuments are no longer to be understood as ‘inert material’ which \ncan only ‘refresh’ memory. History is ‘the work expended on material \ndocumentation’, and the point is ‘to work on it from within and to \ndevelop it’. History also now defines ‘within the documentary material \nitself unities, totalities, series, relations’. It is in this way that we \ncan make sense of Foucault’s declaration that documents become \nmonuments (‘documents into monuments’), so that ‘in our time \nhistory aspires to the condition of archaeology, to the intrinsic \ndescription of the monument’ (Foucault, 1972: 7–14).\nThe Archaeology of Knowledge is concerned not only with dis -\njuncture defined as pure schism, but also with generating new \nconnections. Refusing the latter entirely would, it is acknowledged, \nleave only ‘a plurality of histories’; the distinction is between a total \nhistory and a general one. The blade here is subtle, it cuts, but, in \ncutting, it also sutures. Foucault is interested in dissecting ‘systems \nof relation’ between series, in the conditions of possibility that dictate \n‘what series of series’ may be established, and in ‘what form of \nrelation may be legitimately described between … different series’ \n(Foucault, 1972: 10). Thinking in tabulated form he articulates this \nas a question about what tables it becomes ‘possible to draw up’.\nIf the arguments of the Archaeology do not espouse absolute \nrelativism or disjuncture, there is also an explicit refusal to frame \nthe archaeological approach as simply a structuralist mode of doing \nhistory (or philosophy, or the history of ideas, for that matter). The \nquestion of legitimation (legitimate description), and the kinds of \ninvestigations this approach might suggest (including taxonomic \nwork), needs to be understood, Foucault argues, in far more than \npurely formal terms. The Archaeology remains a critical project \nand resonates with his other writings on governmentality. The \nking, as he declared in Power/Knowledge must still have his head \n Discontinuous continuity  45\nchopped off if we are to change how we are governed (Foucault,  \n1980).\nMedia archaeology: priority and determination\nThe archaeological intervention has latterly been felt with some \nforce in media and cultural studies, in software or code studies, and \nvia a somewhat discrete mode of media archaeology developed in \ncinema studies by Thomas Elsaesser (2004, 2016). One core activity \nhas been in medium theory where Jussi Parikka has done much to \ndefine its activities and orientations (see later). Media archaeology \nhas gathered under its aegis a wide set of writings and writers, some \nadopted retrospectively as progenitors – McLuhan, Mumford, and \nEllul are often invoked, perhaps in ways that would make them \nuneasy, had they any choice in the matter. Media archaeology tends \nto be defined as a collection of related approaches rather than a \nsingle discipline (Parikka, 2012), but as a whole the project is deeply \nin debt to Foucault’s archaeology, and influential practitioners of \ndigital or computational media archaeology have found inspiration \nin Foucault’s insistence on discontinuity, and his demand that attention \nbe paid to series and strata, and their relations, rather than deferring \nto a presumed external ordering or system imposed from the outside. \nA reviewer of Parikka’s work summed up a commonly held view \nby declaring media archaeology a ‘successor variant’ of Foucault’s \narchaeological project (Anthony, 2012). Some practitioners, however, \nset aside the Foucauldian connection, with its insistence on power \nand domination, preferring the temporal politics of Walter Benjamin, \nor focusing on forms of direct experimentation and remaking (see \nGoodall and Roberts, 2019).\nMedia archaeology is a response to the challenge of writing media \nhistories, a search for an approach and/or method that can adequately \ntake account of the circular, the recursive, the submarining, the \nlooped – these dynamics and characteristics being read as the \ntemporalities of the machine, or as intrinsic characteristics of technical \nmedia. A fault in ‘standard’ media histories is summed up as their \ntendency to resolve the complex temporalities and simultaneities of \ntechnological operations into standard linear time (lines). Doing so, \nit is argued, means both that technical operations are not accounted \n46 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nfor and that (therefore) the consequences of the instantiation of \nthese technologies as cultural techniques, or as pervasive cultural \nlogics, cannot be understood. Thus Geert Lovink characterizes the \nmedia archaeologist Wolfgang Ernst’s work as a mounting a direct \nchallenge to ‘the usual chronological reading of media, from photo \nand radio to television and the Internet’ (Lovink, 2003).\nThe critique is above all topical. The rise of technical media \nmeans rewriting history and/or demands finding new ways in which \nit may be undertaken. For media archaeology advocates, older \ntheoretical frameworks are strikingly out of place in the contemporary \nworld. Standard media studies are charged with an obsessive attach-\nment to linear development, said to be a consequence of the desire \nto map a human narrative of progress at the expense of considering \nwhat other forms of ordering are out there – orderings which might \ncome prior to what is viewed as a ‘reduction’ into narrative and its \ntemporalities. This approach is said to strip out the complexities of \ntechnological orderings and temporalities. In response, the media \narchaeological project seeks to understand what other possible \npatterns emerge if the lens is widened, the perspective altered, and \nnarrative organization set aside.\nThe above is in danger of over-compressing the multiple approaches \nof media archaeology. This media-archaeological thinking that focuses \non priority, linearity and recurrence, and significance is now looked \nat in more detail, being found to offer a resource to assist in the \nproject of doing anti-computational history whilst also being found \nto be problematic. This is a friendly critique, however. It is undertaken, \nas Skågeby and Rahm (2018) put it in their account of feminist \nmedia archaeology, with the intention of being useful.\nErnst, priority (and the material conditions of legibility)\nFriedrich Kittler, the German medium theorist often regarded as a \nfather to media archaeology (an aptly patriarchal label, given his \ngender politics), exploring cinema, gramophones, and typewriters, \nfamously argued that the media have come to determine the situation \n(Kittler, 1997). Elsewhere, he took on questions concerning computing \nmore directly, arguing that the dilemma between ‘code and language \n… seems insoluble’, so the program will run when the programmer’s \n Discontinuous continuity  47\nhead is empty of words (Kittler, 2008: 46). The corollary of this \nmight be that language may come (or be heard) only after code \nstops running. Echoes of Kittler can be heard in the account of \ncomputational temporality developed by Wolfgang Ernst, who makes \nstrong claims that in the time of technical media new forms of \ninquiry are needed. Ernst’s work is avowedly (also) in the lineage \nof Foucault (see Parikka, in Ernst, 2013: 4) and Ernst’s M.edium \nF.oucault (2000), and he retains a central interest in questions of \npower. But if Ernst is an heir to Foucault’s archaeology, he also \nbreaks with it, replacing the document with the material. For Ernst, \nmedia now condition ‘the way in which we know things and do \nthem – knowledge and power’ (Parikka, in Ernst, 2013: 6). In doing \nso, he is not alone. As Lovink (2003) notes, ‘whereas Foucault \nlooked into social formations, today’s media archaeologists are \nprimarily interested in the (hidden) programs of storage media’.\nFor Ernst, this produces a project centred on an investigation \ninto the material (pre)conditions of legibility, material conditions \nthat temper time and space and determine the character of the place \nof possibility. This is understood as a historical inquiry, but also as \nan intervention into history itself, one that grapples with (what \nErnst sees as) the transformed conditions of its possible operation. \nRefusing to flatten technology so that it can become just another \nelement of a history that is smoothly linear partly because it dissolves \nthe intractable and non-linear operations of heterogeneous materials \nin order to produce its text, Ernst mounts a direct ‘critique of media \nhistory in the narrative mode’ (Lovink, 2003). Recognizing that \n‘(the) cultural burden of giving sense to data through narrative \nstructures is not easy to overcome’, he nonetheless regards this as \nnecessary. Ernst’s work is striking for its formal concentration on \nquestions of temporality that emerge outside of narrative structures. \nIt is the techniques and temporalities of the computational, excavated \nthrough an examination of hardware, that inform his explorations \nof the new ‘conditions of the sayable and thinkable’. His media \narchaeology is defined as ‘an excavation of evidence of how techniques \ndirect human or non-human utterances ’ (Ernst, in Parikka, 2013).\nHow might what Ernst offers be responded to? His approach \nprovides a sense of the complexity of the contemporary temporal \norder and, in challenging a history purged of the impacts of the \noperations of technical media, opens the way to undermine the \n48 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nconventional ascription of a narrative of linear progress to compu -\ntational developments and to techno-social forms. However, one of \nthe dangers of media archaeology is that it tends to essentialize.\nThe desire to fix on the material can, paradoxically, make technol-\nogy into something imaginary, leaving no space to consider or \nacknowledge the impurity of the operational. The substitution of \nan abstract material for a materiality thought impure unless purged \nof its pesky hybridity produces accounts that ignore the intersection \nof the symbolic and the material, the discursive and the linguistic, \nthe code and the hardware; the complexities of the interacting elements \nthat constitute any computational network in operation, that handle \nmediation. Material specifics are lost as a series of disavowed replace-\nments take place. Kate O’Riordan has aptly characterized ‘objects’ \nsuch as these as ‘unreal’ (O’Riordan, 2018). That this causes occlu-\nsions is evident. Returning to Kittler’s proclamation that code and \nlanguage are inimical, so that the dilemma between ‘code and \nlanguage’ seems insoluble (Kittler, 2008: 40), we may note that it \nentirely steps over the question of how code – on its own – signifies. \nJaron Lanier has explored this problematic in terms of scale (Lanier, \n2010), and Wendy Chun in relation to the gap between the program \nand the program running (Chun, 2008b: 224). Both their interventions \nmake it clear that it is in process that the disjuncture between the \nabstract system and its located instantiation is made most visible, \nand where the mutually informing relationship between the symbolic \nand material becomes inescapable. Refusing an absolute division \nbetween the symbolic and the material therefore seems to me crucial. \nThis also means refusing the absolute priority and that absolutely \nchronological ordering that is seen in Ernst’s work, that which divides \nthe technological (as what came before) from the social world (as \nthe social formation) as that which always comes after – the irony \nbeing, of course, that this ordering is itself insistently linear. One \nof the consequences of Ernst’s argument is that it inserts a prior to \nthe prior; what came before technical determination, how can the \ngenesis of the technical be contemplated? Stiegler’s development of \nco-evolution, which includes an account of originary technicity, \nproduces a useful contrast here (Stiegler, 2013). Even Parikka, a \nmedia-archaeological loyalist, talking of myths rather than imaginar-\nies, suggests that Ernst is in danger of ‘mythologizing the machine \nas completely outside other temporalities, including the human’, in \n Discontinuous continuity  49\nhis attempt to offer ‘insight into the a priori of writing’ (Parikka, \nin Ernst, 2013: 10).\nLinearity and recurrence?\nA different media-archaeological intervention is made by Erkki \nHuhtamo, who seeks to grapple with non-linear and discontinuous \nhistories, these characteristics both informing his theoretical orienta-\ntion and also discerned as operational temporalities in a multimedia \nage (Huhtamo, 1997, 1999). His identification of patterned recurrence \ncleaves rather tightly to, and develops, Foucault’s sense of the series \nand its connections/disconnections. It is developed specifically in \nrelation to media technologies and works through a theory of topoi \nthat prioritizes discourse rather than material (here is the break \nwith Ernst).5\nParallels between recurrence as Huhtamo explores it and the less \nmedia archaeological, but nonetheless archaeological orientation \nfound in historian Valerie Traub’s consideration of the deep history \nof bodies and sexualities (referenced in Chapter 1 and later explored \nfurther) can be drawn here. Demonstrating the recurring ‘salience’ \nor intelligibility of various bodily tropes (tropes expressed as bodily \nmaterializations of various forms of sexuality) across long periods \nof human history, Traub’s focus on what is written on or through \nbodies indicates ways in which inquiries that focus on discourse \nmay deal – albeit in very different ways, and not in ways likely to \nsatisfy Ernst – with the latter’s demand for an inquiry into legibility \nand its material conditions in technical times. Moreover, as is further \nexplored later, both Huhtamo and Traub are concerned to acknowl-\nedge continuities and simultaneously to comprehend discontinuity \nand disjuncture.\nSignificance: media archaeology and its subject choices\nHow does media archaeology choose its objects? It has a penchant \nfor neglected histories and forgotten or obscure objects or people. \nOften it selects its research objects in the interests of producing new \npatterns or circuits, or discerning new connections across categories \n50 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nthat are conventionally divided. Zielinski’s deep history of devices \nfor hearing and seeing is an example of this (Zielinski, 2006), Parikka’s \nInsect Media (2010) another. Then there are studies focusing on \nsmall, abstruse, or unlikely elements of assemblages more often and \nmore ‘obviously’ explored at different scales or in different registers. \nErnst is one such practitioner and is reinvoked later. Finally, experi-\nmental media archaeology is focused on remaking and building and \nreusing old technologies now obsolete (Goodall and Roberts, 2019).\nMedia archaeology has been criticized for these choices, charged \nwith maintaining a preference for ‘what matters less’ that is voguish, \nwhimsical, or fractious. Even some of its own adherents fear that \nbad object choices undermine the larger project of media archaeology, \ndefined as the remaking of medium history (e.g. Hertz, 2010). From \noutside the tent Scott Anthony (2012) is again representative, summing \nup one vein of external criticism of media archaeology through this \nscathing description of its ‘values’:\nThe ‘what if’ of roads not taken is prized over a present whose virtues \nare assumed to be overstated. To pay dues to the mainstream, to \naccept at face value, or take common parlance seriously is nearly \nalways to be beneath contempt.\nThis criticism provokes a defence of media archaeology’s choices \n– and perhaps also of my rationale in working through ‘non-obvious’ \nobjects in my exploration of the anti-computational. Playing at \n‘what if’ as an end in itself is found in media archaeology; however, \nit doesn’t fit as a description of the whole (it might characterize a \nlargely uninteresting form of work). In its most incisive forms media \narchaeology sets out, using tactics including the counterfactual, \nprecisely to question those relations between the past and present \nthat have produced, as the present, and as the present imaginary, a \nset of naturalized objects and naturalized histories, already lined up \nand ranked as the ‘mainstream’.\nJussi Parikka has taken up this issue, arguing that in his writing \napparently unlikely, or trivial, or arbitrary object choices are valued \nbecause they can confound established categories through which \nstandard histories work. Thinking of insects as media, for instance, \nhe intends to confuse divisions between (what tend to be thought \nof as) media and other systems; precisely those divisions which set \nthe boundaries of various forms of intelligibility – conditioning \n Discontinuous continuity  51\nlegibility in public discourse, or policing disciplinarity and knowledge \nclaims between defined research fields, for instance. It can be argued \nthat one way in which media archaeology does engage with ‘the \nmainstream’ is by challenging its border and limits, its banks and  \nits dams.\nErnst’s rationale for paying attention to technical media represents \na different challenge to media archaeology’s object choices. The \nburden of his position is that technical media constitute the main-\nstream even if this is not widely recognized (yet), nor its implications \ntraced out. His objects of study are those determining the new \noverarching conditions of intelligibility. If computational technologies \nbeat out our time, condition utterance, or discourse, and remake \nwriting, then it is crucial that we study them, no matter how obscure \nthey may appear. What is closely argued in Ernst is arguably present \nas an ambient sensibility informing digital media archaeology in \ngeneral; it underpins claims made for the significance of the technical \nover the representational, a prioritizing that also determines how \nmediation is understood and what its stakes are. This is the case \n‘now’ if not before, since ‘now’ we live in times of pervasive comput-\ning, in the aftermath of a shift in episteme ushered in by the rise of \ntechnical media. You don’t have to go all the way with Ernst to \nrecognize the value of the perspective his work opens up.\nMedia archaeology versus cultural studies?\nMedia archaeology has often been hostile to cultural studies. The \nlatter is framed as preoccupied with representation, obsessing over \nthe abstract operations of ideology, and focusing on the technological \nimaginary, rather than attending to the thing itself. The charge is \nof tilting at ghosts rather than tangling with the real, of failing to \nunderstand the impact, and importance, and/or the informing force \nof the material operations of technical media. There are commonalities \nbetween media archaeology and other engagements with revived \nforms of (new) materialism. The computational turn (see Wing, \n2006, Lanier, 2010, Berry, 2011), traditional digital humanities, \nsoftware, code, or protocol studies, objected-orientated philosophy \n(OOO), represent very different critical/post-critical orientations – but \nall resonate sympathetically with the media-archaeological suspicion \n52 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nof the utility of cultural studies approaches to the study of media \n(Bassett, 2020).\nAgainst this I make a case for (a form of) media archaeology as \n(a form of) cultural studies, seeing this as both nascent in various \nways and as a desirable evolution. The argument to be made is that \ncultural studies approaches can contribute to developing forms of \nmore critical media archaeology, and media archaeology can con-\ntribute to re-materialization of cultural studies – and cultural histories. \nBringing the two together produces new approaches; not least, it \nenables new forms of digital humanities to be developed. To stress, \nthis is not a matter of joining what was before entirely divided; it \nis to acknowledge that media archaeology, like digital humanities, \nis a cultural study – or it is nothing.\nSome unpacking is needed. This begins with an acknowledge -\nment that in some of its iterations cultural studies has neglected the \ninforming force of material in favour of an exclusive attention to \nrepresentation, which latter is understood as powerfully performative, \nconstructing that which it names in accordance with ideologically \ndetermined presuppositions and alignments. The result is a failure \nto attend to the operations of technical media and the forms of \nordering that arise as a consequence of their technical affordances. \nIf some forms of media archaeology strip out the imaginary as a \nnecessary component of the technical, some cultural studies strip out \nthe operations of – the matter of – the medium, producing a woefully \nflattened understanding of what is under investigation and of how it \nis powerful. Crude representationalism can never grapple with new \nforms of data-driven visuality that organize platform subjectivities, \nfor instance, nor can it grapple with the space-time compressions/\ndistensions characteristic of digital operations. However, currents \nwithin cultural studies have responded to the clash of material-\nisms, asking how historical materialism (and other modes of critical \nanalysis) and the various forms of attention to ‘the material’ that \nnew materialism wishes to prioritize can be brought into new rela-\ntion. By the late 20th century, the New Cultural Studies  reader \n(Birchall and Hall, 2006) had already included vociferous calls \nfor new kinds of post-humanities – explicitly declaring the need \nto break with earlier traditions, or to remake them in relation to  \nrising forms.\n Discontinuous continuity  53\nBut cultural studies, certainly in its Birmingham or UK versions, \nnever confined itself to representation, in any case. In many of its \nmost influential forms it has been explicitly informed by a desire to \nengage with material culture. It is salutary to remember that Stuart \nHall, thought of as a co-founder of the field, explored the racist \ndiscourses of policing in the UK through an exploration of ‘mugging’ \nwhich never lost sight of the material violence acted out on \ndiscriminated-against bodies (see Hall et al., 2013). Even Hall’s \nwork on encoding/decoding, widely viewed as the epitome of a \nparticular kind of media and cultural studies, which avowedly \nprivileged the semiotic moment in circuits of culture, did not set \naside material processes and technologies involved in production, \nnor those involved in reception (Hall, 1992).\nThere are also connections to be made with a mode of anthro -\npologically orientated media studies undertaken in the 1980s and \n1990s, which evidences further an extant tradition of engagement \nbetween medium theoretic and more discourse-orientated research \n– and a prioritization of non-obvious research objects. Scholars of \nmedia and everyday life (Silverstone, 1994, Highmore, 2001) \ninfluenced by Hall found resources in the medium thinking of Marshall \nMcLuhan and in Joshua Meyrowitz’s (1986) exploration of technical \ntime and space, as well as in the historically materialist work of \nRaymond Williams (2003). Of note is the degree to which the 20th-\ncentury French tradition of the study of everyday life informed this \nwork – particularly that of Silverstone (1994) and Morley (2007). \nFollowing this trail is relevant because the French focus on the \nobjects, textures, materials, and orderings of everyday life led to a \nre-evaluation of the significant. Perec’s forensic investigation of the \ninfra-ordinary, often deploying data-driven or automatic techniques \nto pay attention to apparently insignificant object (pens, desks, \nspoons), produces a meditation on everyday life and its objects that \nsees them as both what matters least and what matters most. It can \nbe understood as simultaneously a kind of media archaeology and \ncultural studies (Perec, 2009, Bassett, 2017).\nPerec’s work can seem fey. Perhaps it appears consciously vogueish \n– to return to the critique of media archaeology invoked earlier. But \na harder look at his writing on the everyday and its relentless rhythms \nand repetitions reveals an account that is always aware of matters \n54 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nof resistance, and also of systematic domination. At this point we \ncan link it forwards and see it as part of that tradition of cultural \nstudies which has never forsaken the material, but which has also \nalways refused to divide the material from the symbolic, which has \nalways been aware both of power and of its multiple operations; \ncultural Marxism, after all a reasonably standard description of \nHall and the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies, was never \npurely a matter of the study of representations and the ideological \npositionings they revealed circulating in discourse.\nReturning to terms Foucault used (and Wolfgang Ernst adapted), \nwe might say that if cultural studies refuses the substitution of the \ndocument with the machine (Ernst’s move), since it continues to \nmaintain a sense of the importance of the symbolic – in the mediating \noperations of the computational, as well as elsewhere – it also refuses \nto stay with discourse. Rather, it enables a theoretical space within \nwhich more than a reversion to the document, as a response to the \nlacunae produced by media archaeology’s focus on the purely technical \nas that which is significant about pervasive mediation, can be \ncontemplated. To invoke an example here, in a later chapter I argue \nthat the fact that ELIZA, a software program, could tell stories and \nhad a cover story as a therapist was of significance. The argument \nis that these aspects of what ELIZA did were as materially informing \nin the bot’s reception as the script and algorithm that formally \nconstituted the program. Contra Ernst, machines may tell narrative \nhistories. More, they may become operational in machinic ways. \nGoing back to Foucault, and to the much-disavowed structuralism \nthat, despite Foucault’s own protestations, haunts the Archaeology, \nwe might note that narrative itself has for a century or more been \nsubject to attempts to understand it computationally (Bassett, 2007). \nELIZA has also been explored through feminist theory (e.g. recently \nby Sarah Dillon, 2020) and another key locus here is feminism, \nparticularly feminist techno-science, whose influence on cultural \nstudies has been large and which has long understood and argued \nfor a blurring of precisely these boundaries (e.g. Bassett, O’Riordan \nand Kember, 2020). Neither document nor technical media, then. \nThrough cultural studies the Foucauldian document has been re-\nmaterialized differently – and in ways that expand rather than simply \nswitch over what is taken as the proper object of study. The result \nis the possibility of a socio-technical media study containing multiple \n Discontinuous continuity 55\nmaterials, multiple temporalities, multiple actors. This also defines \nan expanded – and desirable – form of digital humanities.\nForgetfulness and anti-computing\nThe basic position outlined above can now be further developed \nand brought closer to the proximate concerns of anti-computing \nthrough a consideration of forgetfulness – which latter can be \nunderstood as a feature of technical media, as a logic strongly \noperating within contemporary forms of computational capitalism, \nand as entailed in computational imaginaries. Forgetfulness is one \nkey to understanding the operational version of the presentism \nidentified as an extant feature of anti-computing. Accepting that \ndivisions between media archaeology and cultural studies are not \nabsolute, that parallels and shared orientations to be found, that \nthe grounds each claim are already partly occupied by the other, \nthen potentially they may be put to work to grapple further with \nwhat has been defined as a key characteristic of anti-computing, its \npersisting disappearance and reappearance across time, which is to \nsay how it is forgotten and remembered. This dynamic challenges \nattempts to account for anti-computing through forms of history \nrelying entirely on disjuncture, as well as those that understand \nsignificance and order strictly in terms of continuity and linearity. \nThe issue might be how to bring these accounts into relation, and \nhow that might be productive. Approaching this, I intend to work \nthrough forgetfulness from both sides.\nFirst, then, technological forgetfulness and machine ontology. \nContemporary emphases on technical media and the organization \nof temporal experience resonate with earlier work exploring cinema. \nThe trajectory identified (roughly from Kittler to Ernst, from film \nto the computational) links the mechanization of the persistence of \nvision with the rise of computational operations and mediation, \nand sees both as the conditions enabling and organizing other social \nand cultural forms (which then become inadequate as ways of \nunderstanding the world, since they cannot capture the reality of \nthings, including such media things – this is more or less Ernst’s \nargument with narrative history). Kittler’s discussion of cinema \nexplores how technology automates the ‘persistence’ of vision, or \n56 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nthe burning in of an image so that it persists as an after-effect, a \nphenomenon of human optics (Kittler 1999, Bassett, 2015). What \nis received is discontinuous but so organized that we may accept \nits results as continuous – to echo Foucault on the Panopticon, and \nby doing so point to how these arguments relate also to matters of \npower. In the case of the computational, persistence is not the issue, \nbut a different form of discontinuous continuity does pertain: that \nwhich is produced by reprogrammability. The universal machine, \nbased on reprogrammability and simulation, has to forget in order \nto operate the next program (and storage is not the same as working \nmemory). Even neural network-based AIs find memory difficult.6 \nComputational operations are discrete, even if, as Beatrice Fazi, \nsuggests, there is a case for arguing that they are not entirely \ndeterminate (Fazi, 2018).\nInstantiated computational technology expands this affordance \nto require forms of forgetfulness in its users, in particular, inviting, \neven demanding, forgetfulness (absent-mindedness) about the technical \nmedia system itself and about its mediating operations. This is the \npromise of direct connection, of object manipulation, of ‘writing’ \non a screen without having to think about writing as coded. Here, \nthen, the injunction to forget has taken a new form. It has it has \npassed from the necessary forgetfulness of the cut that joins, that \nalso joins human vision to cinematic technique, to produce the \nimage, which was essential to cinema. It has passed to an interface \nthat conceals, and suggests forgetting the concealment not of a \nscreen apparatus but, rather, of that which is not screened but is \nnonetheless computed and therefore mediated in new ways (not \nonly as vision, but in code). A measure of what is deemed successful \nin interface design has, after all, long been that we (feel we) reach \nthrough, touch directly, internalize the interface (suddenly cinema \nand computing move closer together). An examination of the technical \naffordances of this form of technical media can suggest all this.\nWhat is still missing and needs to be included is the degree to \nwhich forgetfulness is ‘built in’ as a standard industrial and marketing \nstrategy. And this takes us towards matters of political economy. \nConsider, then, that the injunction to forget is intrinsic to what \nmight be termed upgrade culture in general, the logics of which are \nexemplified in the upgrade itself. Upgrades, that is, are designed to \nensure that sufficient continuity is quietly provided – whilst novelty \n Discontinuous continuity  57\nis loudly delivered. An example at one scale is the tablet, emerging \nas an elision between the computer and the smartphone, but pro -\nclaimed as a new category; the versioning of software providing for \nhigh levels of skilled use by retaining key organizational features \nwhilst promising radical advances constitutes another. The continuous \nrenewal of the skeuomorphic features of interfaces and devices, a \nconstantly upgrading invocation of what was there, in the last version, \nor the last but one, is characteristic of this formation in general; \ncontrary to claims that the imitative interface is over (Worstall, \n2019), imitation is a generalized principle. The chameleon capacities \nof the computer, and of code, its capacity to imitate, and the tendency \nto retain but push into the background what has become stable \nmeans computing developments can take on the feel of the era when \nthey emerge, silently and very fast.7 The result might be an amnesiac \ncondition, partial but real, partly consented to, that could be said \nto extend from (what is given as the affordances of) technologies \nand platforms, through use, to users themselves. Contemporary \ngenerations of ‘digital natives’, supposedly the inheritors of an extreme \nform of what Jaron Lanier (2010) terms cultural neoteny, become \nrelevant here. For these perpetually refreshed, and therefore perpetu-\nally infantile, groups of users, so we are often told, the world before \nthe technological now, their digital, is literally ‘unthinkable’. Moreover, \ntheir version is what counts. They are the mainstream, and the \nbackwaters of the past, with all its old lags, human and technical, \ndo not really count in the ‘here and now’ at all.\nFinally, forgetfulness, explored through a consideration of the \nontological qualities of the computational, of the contradictory \ndemands for compatibility (familiarity) of the novelty which the \nmarket generates (and satisfies to some temporary extent), and of \nthe kind of forgetfulness this encourages, may be explored at a \nlarger scale still; that is, as organizing elements in the techno-social \nrelations of computational capitalism. At this scale these relations \nentail another (related) kind of forgetfulness.\nCompulsory technology?\nEllen Meiksins Wood has argued that an older market system became \ncapitalist when it became compulsory (Wood, 2012: 40). Computing \n58 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nis now a core part of that (market) system’s logics and underpinning \noperations, and, following Wood’s line of thought, it can be argued \nthat a variant on this – informational or computational capitalism \n– emerges as computation becomes necessary, or itself compulsory, \nas the figure and material form of that system, part of its emergence \nas a truly global system, organizing (the uneven terms of) relations \nfor all within its spaces of flows and its backwaters (Castells, 1996).\nWe live within this formation. The global reach of satellites and \nthe intimate touch of population databases, and the rise of biotech, \nprovide proofs of that if they are needed. What does this mean? \nDoes it mean that the only form of computing we have now is what \nwe are ‘given’ by the market, and that the way of life (and forms \nof culture this enables/entails), the compulsory way of life, is the \nonly form of life available? Is choosing between pre-set options the \nonly choice that may be made? Matt Fuller has convincingly argued \nthat the software forms which the market makes are not the only \nforms that may be made, and this pertains at other scales. I will \nreturn to this. For now, it is clear that what is implied is that comput-\ning arrives materially and symbolically in chains, that it tends to \ntake forms or develop along trajectories that appear to be ‘inevitable’, \nor ontologically directed. It is easy, then, to forget or overlook the \ndegree to which they are formed contingently in relation to markets \nor to the social structures that are bound into them. The forms of \nthe computational are thus so mainstreamed that they appear ‘natural’, \nperhaps.8 The computer industry itself plays a part in this. It fore-\ncloses, by way of the visions it offers, by way of the technologies \nit does not support, through the closing down of open systems, the \nsystematic acquisition of the innovative by the giants, on that vision \nor sense of how computing could reach beyond the market and \ncould take different forms entirely. It would rather we choose between \nthose (highly constrained) ‘choices’ within the grounds it prescribes, \nand these are the grounds of compulsory capitalism.\nThis strongly articulated invitation to forgetfulness, discerned as \npart of the ontology of the computational object, identified as a \nmaterial possibility exploited and operationalized by the computer \nindustry in its designs, so that it becomes embedded, reinforced \nthrough the production of a technological imaginary that fetishizes \nthe new but – in the manner of the fetish – also withholds it, can \nthus also be connected to dominant techno-cultural temporal logics \n Discontinuous continuity  59\nwith their intense focus on the present, and their claims, urgent \nenvironmental issues about the future notwithstanding, for the \nobliterating significance of the now. And we should talk of the space \nof the now as significant, since that prioritization of space over \ntime, which Jameson (1991) understands as operationally dominant \nin late capitalism, is very clear here. Computational forgetfulness \nand present-obsessed capitalism are co-dependent in the contemporary \nformation, designating what constitutes its mainstream and informing \nits relation to the past and the future.\nAnti-computing, as a found phenomenon, developed as a critical \nintervention and constituting a methodology, both confirms this \nstate of affairs and disrupts it. It confirms it by its tendency to fade, \nto appear novel, to fall out of the present. It disrupts it firstly in \nthat it points to the possibility of other possibilities by refusing or \ndissenting from that which is offered (and in that restricted sense \nit works by way of negation). Secondly, it is significant in that it \narises at all, since in doing so it questions the authority that compels \nus forwards; compulsion falters. Anti-computational formations \nproduce questions about what ‘we’ are supposed to want, or how \n‘we’ are ‘supposed’ to think about computers, how ‘we’ are ‘supposed’ \nto forget them, on the one hand, and move on with them in the \nsmoothly reassigned grounds of the permanent present of the markets \nthey support and help to create, on the other.\nA third way in which anti-computing is disruptive is that it arises \nagain. Alongside forgetfulness, or the tendency of anti-computing \nformations to subside, to fail to have continuous purchase, to operate \nhorizontally as it were, is that other (related) characteristic already \nidentified – recurrence or recrudescence. When anti-computing arises \nor gains some purchase its forms are distinctive in that they relate \nto arising events or technological developments, but they are often \nalso very familiar. The same questions have been raised, the same \nobjections voiced, the same unease generated, around certain elements \nof computational culture, over and over again. Further, if they are \noften raised each time as if new and/or in less than perfect knowledge \nof the last time around, which is say that they are raised forgetfully, \nthey also, having risen, reconnect and refind earlier forms of contesta-\ntion. Anti-computing has a submarine legitimacy to draw upon.\nAnti-computing is a recurring position, and the moments I explore, \nwhich exhibit complex temporalities within themselves and which \n60 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nare assembled as matter-centric collections, heterogeneous archives \nrather than documents, are fragments of a much larger-scale loose \nformation, operating across time and developing, scaling, albeit not \nin linear ways. The erratic persistence of many forms of anti-\ncomputing matters. To explore the form this takes demands a brief \nreturn to further explore the cyclicality of the reviving salience of \nanti-computational sentiment. This perhaps suggests a diversion, \nbut the patterned recurrence characteristic of anti-computing forma-\ntions suggests how anti-computing operates as the illegitimate other \nof compulsory computing and can also be used to clarify a distinction \nbetween compulsion (or what is compulsory) and (technological or \nany other) determination.\nValerie Traub’s account of the recurring salience of bodily tropes \nover time can be reinvoked here. Salience is the term Traub uses to \nunderstand the recurrence of forms of bodily intelligibility across \nhistory, and thereby to account for a form of historical patterning. \nTraub is concerned to understand forms ‘whose meanings recur \nintermittently and with a difference across time’ (Traub, 2007: 126). \nShe wants to understand how ‘certain perennial logics and definitions \nremain useful, across time’ and how these moments emerge ‘at \ncertain moments, silently disappearing from view … re-emerging \nas particularly relevant (or explosively volatile)’ (Traub, 2007: \n126). Traub is not talking about universal types or trans-historical \ncategories that comprise or subsume historical variation, nor about \nbasic concepts. Her focus is on something more contingent, and \nmore likely to operate at multiple levels. She claims that the logics \nand definitions of the particular material forms bodies take ‘tend to \nreappear in a different guise under changed social conditions’, and \nnotes that the discourses with which they are articulated shift and \nmutate as well (Traub, 2007: 128). In other words, reappearance is \nnever total, and each emergence has singular, as well as common, \nqualities. This is not only a matter of meta concepts returning, but \nof a more heterogeneous persistence, what I might term a reactiva-\ntion. What Traub wants to document (or takes as her ‘document’, \nrelating this back to Foucault and ‘doing history’) is the technology \nof the flesh across long time spans. Hers looks like an account of \nthe discourses that conform bodies, and so might be thought to be \ninformed by the immaterial, to be ‘only’ a matter of representations \nand recurring discourses (in this sense it might seem to confirm the \n Discontinuous continuity  61\nmedia-archaeological objection, and the long-standing objections to \nButler’s work on materialization, to which Barad responded with \nintra-activity theory (Butler, 1993, Barad, 2003). This reading of \nTraub forgets, though, that in her account it is through and in real \nbodies, as real bodies, that these returns are made – that conformation \nis productive and operates to shape matter. That is, it is bodies that \noperationalize and remake revenant discourses; bodies that are the \ngrounds of this discourse, a key part of its fleshing out. To stress \nthis obvious but often overlooked feminist insight – that bodies \nmatter, which is what Butler also taught us – is also to point to an \nimportant way in which discourse and its materials are not to be \nentirely divided – and this may also be applied to the computational. \nAs for bodies, intermixing the symbolic and discursive with the \nflesh, so for machines. The material is not all on one side and all the \ndiscourse and representation on the other. This is new materialism’s \nfetish, but not one we need partake of.\nTraub’s argument constitutes an accounting with relativism and \nnew history, an attempt to reintegrate a sense of continuity whilst \navoiding a simple return to grand narratives. Drawing on archaeologi-\ncal approaches, she is interested in the limits of oscillation (deploying \nFoucault’s term), pushing back against the tendency to develop forms \nof history that are entirely disjunctive; a tendency that has been \nidentified earlier as a characteristic of some forms of media archaeol-\nogy. Her avowed intention is to route around the binary set up by \ncontinuist and disjunctive theories of history (specifically, the history \nof sexuality, but the approach can be put to work here). This places \nTraub at some distance from the feminist ‘anti-history’ of Carla \nFreccero et al., which refuses all linear histories in favour of a kind \nof encounter (Freccero, 2006).\nI go with that distancing, since what I want to generate is emphati-\ncally not (pace Freccero) an ‘anti-history’ of anti-computing. Nor, \nas is already evident, in so far as media archaeology refuses entirely \na certain kind of narrative history, is what I want to do entirely \nmedia archaeological. The point is to let these moments of anti-\ncomputing come into relation with each other, to recognize their \ncomplex temporality, and also to think them through in relation to \nlarger social fabrics and dynamics. Traub, though, has some sym-\npathies with the ‘encounter’, even whilst she also breaks with it, \nand I too find this useful. She suggests a history ‘motivated, both \n62 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nin form and content, by the question: how might we stage a dialogue \nbetween one … past and another?’ (Traub, 2007: 137–138). This \ndialogue is not entirely ‘invented’ or ‘staged’ by the historian; the \n‘pasts’ that are the subjects of this dialogue are already trespassing \non each other’s space, are already in dialogue. This is not a matter \nof a pristine emergence. Traub’s thinking is informed at least as \nmuch by Benjamin’s sense of non-linear time as Foucault’s sense of \nhistory (Benjamin, 2006, Eagleton, 2015), and in this way also \npoints us back to the influence of Benjamin on various forms of \nmedia archaeology itself. Her sense of the return of various repre-\nsentational features (Traub, 2007: 128), of bodies and bonds, is \ncomplex. She does not simply seek to bring the old back into view \n– this would bring back only the dead – nor to deal only with the \nfound return of old representations, particularly if these are viewed \nas discrete from their ongoing and contingent incorporation (the \nparallels between bodily incorporation and machinic instantiation \nare clear here). Her concern is with what is brought back into active \ndiscourse and bodily operation, that is, what is re-incorporated or \nre-materialized. At issue is what becomes affective and active, and \nonce again explosive; what may therefore also transform. Traub \nwants to ask what history does with its bodies. I find this interesting \nand helpful because I want to ask what it does with its machines. \nThe continuous operations of markets both fragment and defragment \ntechnological histories by relentlessly bringing technology stories \ninto the present (compressing them); only what is new and on the \nshelves can be supported (literally and metaphorically) by the continu-\nous orderings and reorderings of neoliberalism, which include the \nreorderings of history. If this leaves the history of computational \ndissent in ruins, the point is not only to refind the ruins. It is to \nrethink how these ruins relate to other moments and to greater \nwholes. And it is also to see how shards of the past trespass on the \npresent and might also in this way project into the future – perhaps \nas moments when compulsion is refused.\nCoda\nIn these two opening chapters anti-computing has been developed \nand is used as an organizing concept. It takes the place of, for \ninstance, a local focus, or a specialist history, or work around a \n Discontinuous continuity  63\nsingle technology, moment, or subject. It tells a series of related \nstories and in doing so produces an overlapping ordering of things. \nIt is the response I offer to Edwards’ call to do computer history \ndespite the difficulty of doing it. But anti-computing is, as well as \nan organizing perspective, something discerned out there in the \nworld. It already has a certain coherence – the same forms and \ndynamics recur – and do so prior to the taxonomic operations of \nanti-computing as an identificatory methodology that I undertake so \nas to give them some further coherence, or to amplify their salience. \nThe following chapters explore some unlikely, forgotten, revenant, \nfamiliar and strange features and moments of anti-computing.\nNotes\n1 Datamation is widely claimed as the first computer magazine.\n2 See e.g. the Covert Criminal Intelligence Sources (Criminal Conduct) \nAct (2021).\n3 Public and expert debates around image manipulation in the interests \nof truth and aesthetics continue in the 2020s, of course. See e.g. https://\nfstoppers.com/originals/thats-photoshopped-yeah-so-does-mean-all-our-\nphotos-are-fake-451724 for a photographer’s view.\n4 See Ithiel de Sola Pool’ s Technologies of Freedom (1983) for an interesting \nexample.\n5 Chapter 4 of this book is in oblique dialogue with Huhtamo’ s serializa-\ntion of interactivity, undertaken in relation to automation. I return to \nsome of the same grounds but establish vectors that bring cybernation \ndebates back into play in relation to labour-precarity issues rather than \nfollowing his trail, which links cybernation to interactivity as a medium \nform (Huhtamo, 1999, see also Bassett and Roberts, 2020).\n6 Their limited capacity to ‘remember’ is, however , something that differenti-\nates them from other more forms of machine learning – for instance, \nMarkov chains.\n7 Catherynne M.

Matusow described his early \nbetrayals in terms of a need for recognition in a world of spectacle \nand in terms of automation – the camera and its distancing vision \nmaking the act of informing on his previous allies palatable. In later \nlife he became a vocal opponent of computers and of the database \nsociety, founding an anti-computing league to fight against the tyranny \nof the automated sort and the automated cache. At one point he \nclaimed as many league members as there were computers in England. \nDrawing on papers from the Matusow archive, this chapter tells an \nanti-computing story with medium transformation, mediatization, \nand the politics of identity at its heart. It plays into the present as \nan early iteration of database anxiety; and it haunts partly because \nit foreshadows the dangerous mixture of ignorance, incompetence, \nand authoritarian malice that characterized dealings around the \nSnowden events.1\n* * *\nI don’t like fascism, don’t like bureaucracy, I don’t like technology. \n(Harvey Matusow, interview, cited in Berenyi, 1971)\nA witness is a paradigm case of a medium: the means by which \nexperience is supplied to others who lack the original. (Durham Peters, \n2001: 709)\nThis is the outrageous story of Harvey Matusow, notorious and \nlater notoriously repentant anti-communist, House Un-American \n70 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nActivities Committee (HUAC) witness, campaigner for Senator \nMcCarthy, contributor to counter-cultural magazines Oz and \nInternational Times (IT), and founder of an anti-computer campaign \n– the International Society for the Abolition of Data Processing \nMachines – which flourished in the late 1960s and early 1970s, \nlargely in the UK, at one point claiming as many members in England \nas there were computers.2\nRolling Stone magazine described Matusow as ‘Hustler Supreme’, \na man who operated under a series of names, boasting that he had \n‘led twelve lives’ (Rolling Stone, 1972: 17 August). His early adult-\nhood was in the Cold War climate of the US. His journey was from \nUS Communist Party (CPUSA) member, to informer and professional \nblacklister, to anti-database campaigner, via a term in prison, a \nperiod in exile, a portfolio career of bewildering dimensions, and \na string of personal reinventions; a life evidencing complex relation-\nships between identity, publicity – and new forms of data sort and \nstorage.\nMatusow is remembered today in relation to the public anti-\nCommunist hearings, but his life story is better understood in relation \nnot only to spectacle but to the list, the archive, and the database. \nOperating as a professional anti-communist witness in the early \n1950s Matusow destroyed the careers and lives of many former \nCommunist Party friends and associates, and those of hundreds, if \nnot thousands, of other people. He did so by dealing in informa-\ntion – generating and collecting it, witnessing to its veracity, and \nclaiming veracity for it through the force of his invocation of it. \nMatusow gave up, and made up, names, contributing to blacklists, \nand invoking names in public, notably in the courtroom. Writing of \nthe parallels between the trials and the McCarthy witch-hunts, the \nplaywright Arthur Miller invokes the concept of ‘spectral evidence’, \nimportant in the events that inspired The Crucible. This required \n‘not the accused person, but [only] his familiar spirit’ to be found \ncommitting a crime (Miller, 2000). Matusow’s ‘spectral’ identifica-\ntions’ (Communist by implication, association, innuendo) assumed \nsubstantial, persistent, and damaging form – and had disastrously real  \neffects.\nFollowing a recantation, Matusow found a role as an ambigu -\nous, and not necessarily welcomed, godfather figure in the UK \ncounter-culture. He was involved in the London Film Co-Op, and \n A most political performance  71\nbecame increasingly concerned with computers, then embedding in \nbusiness and industry, powering government data banks, surfacing \nin various realms of everyday life, and clearly about to expand \ntheir reach further and faster, threatening, as Matusow saw it, ‘to \nswallow us whole’ (Matusow, 1968a).3 In many ways an untaught \nmedium theorist – and avowedly influenced by McLuhan – Matusow \nunderstood computers as media and information systems, machines \nfor the storage and transmission of data, including personal \ndata, which might eventually encode the entire world. And he  \nhated them.\nThe result was the launch of the International Society for the \nAbolition of Data Processing Machines (ISADPM) – President, Harvey \nMatusow. The society was in many ways a media construct and \nlittle substantial activity took place on the ground, although much \nwas promised. It was a minor, but for a time significant, part of a \nbroader public debate in England around the emerging database \nsociety. It resonated with a cultural unease around computerization \nand its medium effects felt in the late 1960s, what might be termed \na database anxiety. For many at that time computers seemed alien \nand the proposition that they might be ‘far more deadly than the \nBeatles’ yellow submarine’, as one US Congressman put it,4 not \nentirely absurd.\nThere is something bathetic about the later lives of Harvey \nMatusow. In the 1950s he was at the heart of events of global \nsignificance in 20th-century history, deeply entangled in the US \ndomestic response to the Cold War. By the 1960s he was a minor \nfigure in the UK counter-culture, chairman of a tiny organization \nin many ways as unreal as the front organizations he had operated \nfor in the 1950s, and certainly less influential. Matusow’s own \nunstable and unreliable personality encourages schismatic readings \nof his life. He was coy, often frankly revisionist, about his past (e.g. \nRolling Stone, 1972). My proposition, however, is that the lives he \nled were not entirely disconnected, and that tracing out connections \nbetween them can be productive.\nUndertaking this task, this chapter has two aims. The first is to \nexplore questions concerning identity arising in relation to databases \nand their automation, where identity is understood as that which \npertains to the self, and where the latter (computerized databases) \nare explored in terms of the processes they enable, including those \n72 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nthat remake the ways in which the individual is known to, defined \nby, produced by, and controlled by various others – including the \nstate. Matusow himself came to believe that database automation \nposed a threat to identity, dignity, and freedom. As he saw it fascism, \nbureaucracy, and (computer) technology were allied. His own experi-\nences suggest why. This is not a psychological reading, however. \nRather, Matusow’s story is understood as symptomatic of broader \ncultural formations. The moment of the anti-computing league \ncoincides with (contributes to) rising awareness of the social con-\nsequences of automation in the UK, and specifically to anxiety around \nthe computerization of everyday life, and perhaps of ‘life’ itself.\nThe second aim emerges with the realization that this is a medium \nhistory. It is this both in terms of its content – Matusow, like \nMcLuhan, was an early media operator – and because it challenges \noverly linear genealogies of media history that emphasize, to the \nexclusion of all else, a shift from representation (old technology) to \ninformation (new technology). Matusow’s own life – let us take it \nas a medium and make its examination a method – points to more \ncomplex entanglements and trajectories. His blacklisting activities \nconstitute a forcible reminder that the database flourished in other \nforms before the advent of its computerized form. New media(tion) \nis (also) old. This can be pushed further. The film theorist Thomas \nElsaesser argued that the internalization of elements of ‘cinematic \nperception’ had put us ‘in … the cinema’ by the middle of the 20th \ncentury, but also insisted on cinema’s entanglement within a broader \naudiovisual history including the phonograph and perhaps the \nBabbage engine (Elsaesser, 2004: 76). Elsaesser’s material history \nprovides an oblique commentary on user histories, and Matusow’s \nstory suggests how these could be extended. For Matusow, at least, \nquestions of storage and access underpinning technical media were \nintegral to the cinematic spectacle as he experienced it ‘live’, even \nif they were not (yet) internalized as more generally extant modes \nof cognition. More continuities emerge if this is viewed the other \nway around; the spectacularization of the political sphere entailed \nby McCarthyism, emphasized by the cinematic quality of the HUAC \nhearings, remains a key mode of politics in today’s computational \ntimes. It is, albeit in altered form, a key feature of contemporary \nnetwork media politics. Jodi Dean (2001), amongst others, has \nexplored the queasy combination of abundant but terminally \n A most political performance  73\nself-referring contributions that constitutes network media in com-\nmunicative capitalism, an ecology that supports endlessly circulating \nforms of spectral performance, not least by ensuring their performative \npower.\nThe archive\nMatusow travelled, but much concerning his life is collected in one \nplace. The Matusow repository at the Special Collections unit at \nthe University of Sussex includes papers and personal documents \nassembled by the man himself. The collection is split, roughly dividing \nthe early and late lives. Each section consists of a series of document \nboxes, along with a small collection of books (e.g. last Whole Earth \nCatalogue, writings on communism in the US, the autobiographic \nFalse Witness) and other visual and audio-visual material, including \nThe Stringless Yoyo, a self-made surrealist documentary made in \n1961. Exploring the collection, I have, not without compunction, \naccepted Matusow as the archivist of his own life. To open the \nbrown cardboard boxes containing materials he assembled is to feel \nhis ghost at my shoulder; there are page numbers scrawled on the \nfront of magazines (e.g. New Scientist),5 envelopes with notations \nclarifying addresses, times, post-coding events, marginalia in the \nbook collection. There is also what he left out. \nThis collection is – of course – a database of a kind, and the \nconnections between fear of a database society powered by computers \nand controlling identity, a distrust of mainstream media arising out \nof an intimate knowledge of its operations, and the desire to send \nan account of oneself into the future by organizing the materials of \nyour own memorialization are easy to see. Matusow, who knew \nlists could produce lies as truths and make those ‘truths’ operational, \nin the end bundled up the analogue materials of his own life story, \nincluding books, papers, stock photography, clippings, original \ndocuments, short-playing records – for posterity. Perhaps he did so \nin a bid to protect his name from the kinds of automated categoriza-\ntions he campaigned against in the anti-computing campaigns and \nfrom the kinds of distortions and untruths (character assassination) \nhe himself promulgated through his spectral identifications. It is \nthus ironic that parts of the Matusow collection are digitalized and \n74 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nin that process are de/recontextualized, in the name of access. I \nwonder how Matusow himself, who gave his story, and specifically \nthose sections on prison and the McCarthy era to the ‘Librarian \nand the Head of Department of American Civilization’ 6 at Sussex \nand whose last will and testament document states that ‘final author-\nity’ ‘for any question which may arise from the use of these files … \nbe the Librarian of the University and the head of Department of \nDepartment of American Civilization jointly’,7 would take this? \nWhilst he did wish that the material ‘be available for research without \nrestriction’, digitalization involves the liquidation of the reassuring \nbulk of the cardboard on the original passport, the ink on the \nnotebook, the fixer on the black-and-white 10 x 8 photographs, \nand the insertion of his history, now in coded form, into far vaster \ndatabases stored on the computer technology that, at one point at \nleast, he disliked so much.\nLooking at the detritus of a life, 8 I am enrolled as both voyeur \nand collaborator, engaging in the dissection and the reproduction \nof an endlessly fragile ego. Further, it appears that this is an ego \nthat first consciously felt itself at risk not from information technology \nbut in relation to the kind of valorization of spectacle that makes \nonly one kind of life real or meaningful – that which is displayed \nin public and celebrated. The collection signals across the years an \nobsession with identity, the stable establishment of which appears \nat once to be desired and desperately to be avoided. A word that \nrecurs endlessly – on greeting cards, on a pass signed by ‘Joe \nMcCarthy’, in articles, plays, recantations, dubious legal documents, \nletters home, remission certificates, a series of passports, society \nphotographs, hotel postcards, a 45rpm record – is ‘Harvey’. Albert \nE. Kahn, the radical lawyer who dealt with Matusow’s recantation, \nsaid ‘[h]e had apparently been unable to discard anything mentioning \nhis name’ (Kahn, 1955: 48). So perhaps Matusow’s fear of com-\nputerization concerned not only what might be retained as ‘fact’ \nand regarded as such, but what might be lost. Pre-capitulating concern \nwith the ‘enduring ephemeral’ (Chun, 2008) of digital memory forms, \nMatusow feared that automation would amplify what was already \na faulty ingestion process; memory itself being lossy.\nWhat can be learned from somebody who has revealed himself \nas a liar? In the preface to Matusow’s autobiography, False Witness, \nwhich he helped to produce, Kahn asks ‘[h]ow can one be sure that \n… having lied so profusely … [Matusow] is now actually telling \n A most political performance  75\nthe truth?’ (Matusow, 1955: 14). The latter addressed his 1950s \nreaders directly: ‘I know that many people will wonder how they \ncan believe me now, when I have lied so often in the past; and I do \nnot expect to be taken merely at my word. Readers will have to \njudge the truth for themselves’ (Matusow, 1955: 17). The archive \nmaterial in Special Collections could be viewed as another invitation \nto people to judge ‘for themselves’.9 Something raised by the Matusow \ncase, after the 1950s, and the 1960s, and after the 1990s web with \nits endearingly hopeful sense of possible completeness, is the relation \nbetween the archive and the archived, and the distance between an \narchive as constituted and the new (increasingly computational or \ndifferently computational) forms it may take as it persists. Into this \nis inserted the question of the relationships and determinations arising \nacross the archival process, particularly relations involving the \ndepositor, and the archive’s human and non-human curators. Matusow \nwanted the cardboard and celluloid archive he sent into posterity \nto speak his always contingent, always unreliable ‘truth’. What \nfollows opens the archive.\nIdentity\nMatusow was born in the Bronx in New York on 3 October 1926. \nHis early life was painfully unremarkable, as is made clear from \nthe collected personal effects. Amongst them a Bar Mitzvah card, \ndated 1939, reads: ‘Congratulations on achieving this first milestone \nto a healthy and happy manhood’.10 A wartime ration book shows \nthat by the age of sixteen Matusow (sex: ‘M’, weight: 160lbs, height: \n5ft 8in, occupation: ‘School’), had a number; 713043-FB. He kept \nhis parents’ ration books too, amongst the official documents he \nhoarded. He did badly at school, graduating on the basis of enlistment \n(Lichtman and Cohen, 2004). A yearbook for Taft Senior in 1945 \nlists him as in the armed forces.11 He fought in the Second World \nWar, spending two years (1944–46) with the US army in Western \nEurope, writing diligently, but with apparently very little to say, to \nhis parents. He returned to New York and joined the Communist \nParty (CP) in 1947 and was initially an active member, including \nin various petitioning operations. In a filmed interview with Jean \nLuc Godard, Matusow said he had joined the CP to be ‘somebody’ \nonce again, rather than being part of a crowd. He told Goddard \n76 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nthat he was too impatient to work on writing, which might have \ngiven him a name. Instead, as he put it in False Witness, ‘wanting \nidentity’, ‘I chose the short cut, I joined the Communist Party’ \n(Matusow, 1955: 21, 26).12 Matusow’s period of active membership \nof the CPUSA was short, although not untypically so, according to \nErnst and Loth’s (highly ideological) contemporary profile of the \nCP ‘everyman’ (Ernst and Loth, 1952).13 He was for a time very \nactive, but was expelled from the CP in 1951, 14 accused of being \nan ‘enemy agent’ (Matusow, 1955: 33, Daily Worker, 19 January \n1951). This accusation was justified, since by February 1950 he had \ncontacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) (Matusow, 1955: \n27), to say he wanted to inform. Another milestone; not one that \nwould lead to happiness.\nCollecting\nEach of the 144 clicks of my shutter caught the face of a friend … \n[This was] my first major report … My future as an informer depended \non the success of my picture taking. I overcame the hesitancy which \nI had in taking my first picture with my second picture … the deed \nhad been done … although these were my friends … it seemed almost \nimpersonal to me. The camera was functioning as an informer, not \nI. (Matusow, 1955: 30, 31–32).\nOn May Day 1950 Matusow attended a New York parade as an \nFBI informer. There he ‘took photos of my friends’ (Matusow, 1955: \n31). With this move he became a collector of names, a contributor \nto the linked and discrete databases gathered as part of the anti-\ncommunist operations of the US government that began from 1947, \nbefore the McCarthy era proper (Cameron, 1987), and ran on well \ninto the 1960s. These operations included loyalty programmes, \ncongressional hearings including the HUAC hearings, blacklisting \n– most notoriously of those in the entertainment industry but also \nof those in journalistic and university professions, trade unionists \nand industrial activists, and the use of various legal instruments \nincluding the Taft Hartley and the Smith Acts (Cameron, 1987). \nThrough his informing camera, which bought him more distance \nfrom his sense of personal betrayal with every shot, Matusow became \nan actor in a greater machine, a larger apparatus – one that often \n A most political performance  77\nappeared to him to be as impersonal as the camera. Moving from \nphotography ‘for his friends’ (who sometimes asked him to photo-\ngraph them), to image capture as ‘evidence’ for the blacklisters, \nMatusow reworks photography from image to data.\nMatusow’s activities as a paid informer, an industrial spy, and a \nprofessional witness, have been considered by many historians \nworking within the context of broader histories of aspects of \nMcCarthyism. Lichtman and Cohen (2004), who used the Matusow \nCollection to produce an authoritative account of the ‘deadly farce’ \nthat constituted Matusow’s engagement with the American establish-\nment during the McCarthy era map this scholarship, and I draw \non them here along with the evidence in the collection. The essential \nfacts are these. Matusow informed and testified for the FBI in HUAC \nsessions, gave evidence to Justice Department cases in various court \nand hearing sessions, and also directly campaigned for McCarthy’s \nSenate re-election campaign on an anti-communist platform. He \nwas active as a professional spy and engaged with private blacklisting \nand anti-communist publishing outfits, notably Counterattack (see \nlater). \nWhat began that May 1950 grew into a cluster of related activities \nthat together constituted the working life of a professional anti-\ncommunist expert. Others were there before him; Matusow placed \ninformers including Elizabeth Bentley, Matt Cvetic,15 Louis Budenz, \nand Herbert Philbrick at the top rung of his new profession. His \nown ‘career’ began with a low-key first appearance in a closed \nsession of HUAC, in which he was at pains to appear modest, not \nwanting ‘to be seen as a glory seeker’. Kahn notes that, modest or \nnot, his testimony was reported in sensational terms (Khan, 1955: \n44). In 1952 Matusow gave open testimony to HUAC after being \nsubpoenaed to do so. A letter to his parents documents his excitement \nabout his more prominent role in the spectacle:\n‘Dear Folks’\nwell we had the first snow of the season …\n… don’t say anything ******* both of you … on 27th November I \nam going to start testifying at the Capital before the House Committee \non UnAmerican Activities … I have been officially called and am very \nhappy about it … DON’T SAY ANYTHING TO ANYBODY …  \n(2 November 1951).16\n78 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nHe was congratulated for this appearance in many quarters, including \nin Counterattack (Matusow, 1955: 43), which later made him an \nassociate editor. By this time any diffidence about the scale of claims \nmade, or the names given, had gone. Matusow later described himself \nas then a ‘publicity addict’, adding that ‘to see the headlines scream \nand a few people cringe’ was satisfying, and so was intervening \nin news agendas; being ‘able to sell a story gave me a badge of \nimportance’ (Matusow, 1955: 65–67). The November 1951 letter \nconcludes with this: ‘When it happens you’ll see me all over the \nNY newspapers, when this happens save them … That’s all for \nnow … Love Harvey.’ The rewards of informing were material, \nproviding earnings and entrée into particular kinds of society, but \nwere also measured by Matusow in terms of fame: ‘I was addicted \nto what printers’ ink could do’ (Matusow, 1955: 70). The archive \nitself is evidence of Matusow’s fascination with the inky spectacle of \nhimself, containing many assiduously collected clippings from this  \nperiod.\nWitnessing?\nJohn Durham Peters defines witnessing as ‘a paradigm case of a \nmedium: the means by which experience is supplied to others who \nlack the original’ (Durham Peters, 2001: 709). False witness is defined \nin the book of Exodus as raising a false report.17 Given that Matusow \nvery often lacked original information and that the names and \naccounts he gave were culled from other press reports, reliant on \nfabricated connections, or made up, he was from the start a false \nwitness. But false or not, it was ‘witnessing’ that was key to his \nburgeoning activities. As he recognized, he did not become a witness \nbecause of his expertise in communism but, rather, used his ‘reputation \nas a witness to establish myself as an “expert” on Communism’ \n(Matusow, 1955: 82). With Bentley and the rest he became known \nas a former communist turned testifier, somebody uniquely qualified \nto speak about CP activities.\nMatusow had a specialism. Youth was his ‘gimmick’ (Matusow, \n1955: 68). He was introduced in the media as an ‘authority on the \n A most political performance  79\nCommunist conspiracy to penetrate the youth of America’ (Kahn, \n1955: 11).18 His ‘revelations’ included the CP’s use of intellectual \nand sexual lures as modes of indoctrination (Matusow, 1955: 77), \nits sinister rewriting of nursery rhymes, Red Scouts, and lurid reports \non licentious goings on at a CP summer camp on Lenin’s Rock. \nAlso notable was Matusow’s activity around New York schools; \na Clark H. Getts presentation leaflet describes him as formerly a \n‘leader of the Kremlin’s youth movement in this country’, adding \nthat ‘amongst his sensational revelations in the press and before \nCongressional committees was the fact that there have been \n“more than one million card-carrying Communists in America, \nand more than 3500 young communists in the schools of New \nYork alone”’.19 He was also involved in a thwarted attempt to \ndesignate Antioch College a red base, and in actions over ‘suspect’ \nbooks held in State Department overseas libraries (see also Zinn,  \n1980).\nIn these and other activities testimony itself became evidence of \nexpertise and expertise reinforced testimony. Matusow’s time as an \nFBI informer was brief, since the FBI quickly understood that his \nclaims were unreliable, but the Justice Department was happy to use \nhim as a witness because of his HUAC reputation as an FBI informer. \nIn this activity, which brought him into contact with Roy Cohn, \nassistant US attorney for the Rosenberg case, and still notorious, \nMatusow gave Grand Jury testimony in the Clinton Jencks case \n(Matusow, 1955: 190). Jencks, a union leader, was indicted and sent \nto prison for offences against the Taft Hartley Act. Matusow thereby \narrived at the pinnacle/nadir of his professional anti-communist \nactivity; the Jencks case was the linchpin in his later recantation. But \nthere were many other activities before that recantation, since, in \nthe public world of politics, there were many things that witnessing \nqualified him for. In 1952 Matusow was an aide in McCarthy’s \nbid for re-election. He spoke on anti-communism in various states. \nHis personal life was transformed. On the way up the ladder as a \nwitness he married Arvilla Bentley, an heiress active in McCarthyite \ncircles. As a moneyed celebrity he dined out, often in the very best \nplaces, on his fame and reputation, and on the misery of those he \nhad incriminated. The menus and the photographs show up in the  \nboxes.20\n80 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nLists and databases\nDear Folks, … Please send me a copy of the “Worker” … DON’T \nFORGET. It’s important that I get it. Love Harvey. (Letter from \nMatusow, American Red Cross, 8 October 1951)21\nThe spectacle of the staged hearings is emblematic of the era in \npopular culture. But supporting the spectacle were the subter -\nranean activities of collection and listing; the naming, capturing, \nstoring, and use of names. Matusow was heavily engaged with this. \nBetween hearings he briefly became ‘official communist hunter for \nthe State of Ohio’ (Matusow, 1955: 55)22 and an industrial spy. \nBack in New York, he associated with anti-red journals and with \ntheir blacklisting operations. One of these was Counterattack, an \norganization combining journalism (including the eponymous journal) \nwith blacklisting – the latter often undertaken as free enterprise. \nCounterattack’s owners were American Business Consultants (ABC), \na firm offering ‘security’ information to employers, including General \nElectric and many large department stores in New York (Matusow, \n1955: 109). Cold War historian Ellen Schrecker notes that whilst \nABC were known for Red Channels, the entertainment blacklist, \ntheir activities were at least as expansive in other areas (Schrecker, \n1998).23 Counterattack was also involved in the murky and lucrative \nbusiness of ‘clearing’ smeared names (Lichtman and Cohen, 2004, \nMatusow, 1955, Schrecker, 1998). Matusow sold subscriptions to the \nprint publication (something he must have felt at home with, given \nhis time in the CP), but this was only the visible tip of the larger \noperation. Counterattack ran on lists. Matusow describes ‘thousands \nupon thousands of names … cross-indexed with corresponding full \ndocumentation’ (Matusow, 1955: 111). McCarthyism undeniably \noperated through mass media and spectacle, and Matusow himself \ndescribed McCarthy as ‘America’s first electronic demagogue, \nriding the airwaves to preach his cause’ (Matusow, 1969), but the \nlisting operations underpinned the public show and extended far  \nbeyond it.\nThe dangerous connections between these categories are evidenced \nin Matusow’s own activities, only initially to be understood as \ndivided between collecting and testifying. Lists invoked in media \naccounts – accepted as really existing lists, independently of the \n A most political performance  81\nspecific entries that made them up – themselves became guarantors \nof proof when invoked in the sensationalized reports to which they \nlent some credence; this despite the fact that they were arbitrarily \ngathered, and often themselves relied on earlier press reports for their \nconstruction. Evidence of this lethal circularity can be found in the \nterrible and banal ways in which teachers were entrapped, and in \nthe notorious claim made to a congressional hearing that there were \n‘well over 100 dues-paying Communists on the staff of the Sunday \nedition of the New York Times’. The total staff of the publication \nnumbered far less than that, but nonetheless the claims were not \nentirely set aside (Kahn, 1987: 11). Categorization itself produced \ndata operating with performative force to designate a threat. To \nput it this way, Matusow’s clear unreliability, the far-fetched nature \nof the claims he made, the obvious issues with the lists he made \n(remarked upon by the FBI), were disguised by, or possible to pass \nover, due to the fact that he had a list. It was in fact his capacity \nto list rather than his capacity to observe which was at the heart of \nhis activities. If the camera captured the images, the listing process \nwhich placed individuals in particular categories laid them down and  \nsorted them.\nBreaking off\nMatusow is dead, for good I hope. (Letter to Billie, 13 January 1954)24\nBy the mid-1950s Matusow wanted to stop informing and remedy \nsome of the damage done. The threads of his life were falling apart. \nHe had broken with the McCarthy camp and had also divorced \nmultiple times.25 He first admitted to lying whilst witnessing (notably \nto the Methodist leader Bishop Oxnam, whom he had earlier slurred), \nwhilst still testifying against others. He was then approached by the \nlawyers Kahn and Cameron, who were working with union leaders \nand others. Their hope was that admissions of lying from Matusow \ncould be used to reopen cases of jailed ‘communists’ – amongst \nthem Clinton Jencks. The mine union worker’s conviction on the \ncharge of being a CP member whilst signing the Taft Harley Act \nhad been supported by just one witness – the ‘bastard’ Matusow.26 \nThe latter’s decision to document his activities, obviously likely to \n82 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nproduce perjury charges, was agonized (see also Kahn, 1955). He \nfeared the end of celebrity and permanent infamy, and at times \nappeared ready to pull back:\nWhen I first returned to New York, I planned to write a book … \nexposing everything … Mc C. Counterattack et al … I was bitter, … \nyou might say sick … unimportant … I was offered a lot of money \nto do … and to make a long story short … I AM NOT WRITING \nTHE BOOK … Reason number one … I don’t belong in politics. \nNumber two … Harvey Matusow couldn’t die if the book was written \n… I would only live in the past … (Letter to Arvilla, 13 January \n1954).27\nFalse Witness did get written. Matusow dictated it to Kahn, who \ntranscribed it (Lichtman and Cohen, 2004). Affidavits signed in the \nrun-up to its publication in which Matusow declared he had made \nfalse testimony under oath sensationally ended his career as an \ninformer and threatened to blow apart the entire system of profes-\nsional anti-communist informers (Schrecker, 1998 and Schrecker \ncited in Lichtman and Cohen, 2004: 162). It did open the way for \ncharges to be laid against him. This wasn’t straightforward, since \nvictims of his testimony who had gone down as communists could \nnot be used as defence witnesses, but material involving Roy Cohn \ncould be and was used (Lichtman and Cohen, 2004).28 Kahn notes \nthat, ironically, this meant that Matusow was never indicted for \n‘what he had confessed to in False Witness … lying as a government \nwitness … helping railroad people to jail, for blacklisting and ruining \nthe reputation of scores of citizens’ (Kahn, 1987: 253).\nIn August 1956 Matusow went to prison. He served some time \nin Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary in Pennsylvania, where the librarian \nwas Wilhelm Reich, known to fellow cons as the ‘sex-box’ man \n(Elmer Swink, IT, 8 May 1956).29 He was paroled early and was \ndischarged from supervision on 3 September 1961, typically saving \nthe parole board certificate from the Federal Prison in Allenwood, \nPA.30 Six years later he left America. He had tried to evade his \nearlier life but, suitably enough, was constantly informed upon. His \ndecision to leave was apparently made after a hostile meeting with \nsinger Pete Seeger’s wife, who held him partly responsible for her \nhusband’s blacklisting. He went to England.\n A most political performance  83\nThe man ‘punching holes in computers’\nIn 1970 Oz, the counter-cultural magazine, launched issue 28, the \nSchoolkids issue, and went to court in a famous obscenity case that \nsentenced two of its three founders to prison (Sutherland, 1982). 31 \nOz was notorious as an organ of 1960s generational rebellion and, \naccording to Charles Shah Murray, one of the kids, the issue arose \nout of a desire to interrogate ‘actual rather than notional’ kids \n(Murray, 2001). Oz had a clear sense of the connections between \nmedium, media style, and political intent. It set out to redefine the \npublishing format. In his account John Sutherland sums it up as ‘a \npolychrome mélange. Pages changed colour, print came from all \ndirections in a vertiginous riot of typography and disorderly layout \n… it had no set format. One issue was entirely pictorial – an “image \nbank” with no words attached’ (Sutherland, 1982: 117). In accord \nwith this, in notes for a project entitled ‘New Horizons’, Oz co-\nfounder Richard Neville, noting the importance of sheer presentation \nto movements at the time, described the alternative society as tel-\nevisual.32 Of Oz he said that ‘in terms of its topography, its use of \ncolours, design and layout, it’s … much more akin, I’d say to a \ncolour TV screen than it is to old fashioned molten lead bits of \nGrey A point type publications which are really the result of a sort \nof nineteenth century way of thinking, … sort of McLuhanistic, \ntactile and lateral … ’.33\nAll the more surprising, then, that on page 45 of the ‘Kids’ issue, \nsomewhere after a notorious cartoon showing Rupert Bear doing \nunimaginable things that shocked English judges, were two starkly \nprinted and formally laid out black and white pages. This was \ndatabase form ‘OHID’. The acronym stood for On Human Individual \nDignity (Oz, 1970).34 The form demanded that users fill in boxes \ngiving information on ‘information quota allowances’, made demands \nfor ‘information averages’, information ‘gains’ or ‘losses’, and ‘sale, \nexchange or involuntary conversation of said information’, and set \nout ‘alternative information computation’ boxes. In short, it was a \nspoof. The author of this medium-theoretic contribution was \nMatusow. In a magazine designed for those whose sensibilities were \nconsciously televisual, he was satirizing computing, databases and \nways in which the computational might be used to redefine, capture, \n84 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nor threaten identity.35 If Oz was beyond print aesthetics, Matusow \nwas beyond the image and into information. 36\nHow did he get there? That is, how did he come to hold this \nposition, what was he doing in Oz? Arriving in England, Matusow \nbecame a journalist and broadcaster. He had some mainstream success \n(e.g. talks to BBC Radio 4, the Third Programme, work with trade \npress publications), but also became a counter-cultural journalist, \ncontributing to underground and alternative magazines, including \nOz and more often IT. He associated with the London Film Co-Op, \nbecame a filmmaker,37 led a band which produced one (very relatively) \nsuccessful album, the War between Fats and Thins,38 and engaged in \nvarious acts of quasi-situationalist activism. He also collected taxis.\nThe arrival in England amounted to a reinvention. Matusow’s \njournalism did reference the US, and even McCarthyism 39 – but \nrarely his own role in it. He wrote as a ‘scene’ insider and as an \némigré, avowedly fascinated by the difference between UK and US \npolitics.40 In the Fats and Thins he invoked his past in indirect terms, \nbut a more sustained engagement is in the Stringless YoYo, a film \nproduced in 1961, which collages HUAC hearings and Nazi rallies, \nboth run backwards to the sound of dance music, and the swirls of \na stringless yoyo, which latter are used to produce psychedelic Bridget \nRiley-style graphical effects. The eponymous yoyo had a bit part in \nthe recantation hearings and revealed the absurdity of the process. \nAt one point, captured on the film, Matusow discusses his invention \nof the yoyo and is asked by his accusers whether the manufacturer \nis or has ever been a communist.41 As a database compilation of a \nseries of archive assets, the film might be an early post-narrative \ndatabase film. It also indexes Matusow’s developing views on \ncomputing itself, thereby bridging his earlier and later activities. \nSometime later, writing about the anti-computing league, he summed \nthis up when he declared, ‘I don’t like fascism, don’t like bureaucracy, \nI don’t like technology’ (cited in Berenyi, 1971).42\nAnti-computing: database anxiety and the anti-computing \nleague (computerized collecting)\n‘Should we … organize mass demonstrations, march on IBM? I don’t \nthink so. If nothing else this is a cool organization. It’s the computer \n A most political performance  85\nthat’s going to get short-circuited. It’s we who communicate. (October \n1969)43\nBy the mid- to late 1960s computers were becoming more visible \nin UK society, and were not only being represented as reclusive \ninstruments for giant corporations, governments, or as Cold War \nweaponry (Stone and Warner, 1970). Their further expansion was also \nunderstood as imminent. A new job category – computer program-\nmer – arose and was widely advertised. New uses for computers in \noffices and businesses generally were under development. The Daily \nMirror commented that in the US ‘the Mets won the world series \nand the bulk of paper thrown out of New York streets turned out \nto be computer punchcards’. The Mirror added that this computer \n‘revolution’ was coming England’s way (Daily Mirror, 17 April 1969).\nMatusow’s growing dislike of computational technology was \nalready evident in the Stringless Yoyo. In the few years following, \nhe wrote anti-computing articles for various outlets. Technology \nbecame a recurring theme in his columns on ‘Anti-Matter’, written \nfor American in London. Drafts in the collection 44 include stories \non social shaping and technology, the unintended consequences of \ninnovation (e.g. the cotton gin), the computerization of personnel \nmanagement in the US army as its difficulties with Vietnam escalated \n(November 1970, column on Vietnam).45 In fragments of a book \ndraft Matusow makes a case for Vietnam as a ‘computer atrocity \nstory’.46 There are also articles on computerization and political \nprocess. In a discussion that seems prescient in the light of the later \nballot-box scandals of the Bush/Gore era and Trump’s use of social \nmedia, Matusow noted dryly that ‘now we have a computerized \npresident’.47\nHowever, the major focus of Matusow’s anti-computing activities \nconcerned the consequences for individuals of the computerization \nof everyday life, particularly life in the UK, specifically in relation \nto databases.48 Around 1968 or earlier, declaring himself ‘interested \nin the abuses of the computer’ he founded an anti-computing society. \nThe International Society for the Abolition of Data Processing \nMachines, or ISADPM, which took off a few years later, and had \nsome reach by the late 1960s, had as its aim ‘the destruction of \nman’s over-dependence on the computer’ (Matusow, 1968b: 7). In \nthe UK it gained a membership of up to 7,000 people and had some \n86 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nresonance. It helped to make Matusow an unofficial spokesman for \nanti-computing sentiment in general for a period. The Society was \nalways most active in England, but there were copycat outfits in \nother countries (e.g. in New Zealand and Germany) and some \nISADPM material, including the ‘atrocities’ book (Beast of Business, \nsee later), was translated into German. There were also claimed \nlinks with Japan.49\nThe ISADPM logo was a catapult, a ‘symbol for battle’, man \npitted against the giant machine. Matusow recognized that a sling \nwould be more correct, but he didn’t think a total war against \nmachines could be won anyway. Of his society he said we ‘are not \nLuddites as such’ (see Daily Mirror, 16 January 1969: 11). 50 The \nbattle was ‘against over dependence’ 51 and the unwanted intrusion \nof the computer into unnecessary areas. It was allowed that the \ncomputer might have a ‘constructive function’ in ‘mathematics and \nthe other sciences’. But when ‘the uses of the computer involve \nbusiness or government … the individual is tyrannized – and … \nsociety makes its stand’ (Matusow, 1968b: 22).\nMatusow’s hostility came in three parts. He raised practical \nobjections to (what he saw as) an over-reliance on computers, and \nin this context also objected to what he saw as a widespread over-\nestimation of their powers: ‘firms which use them expect too much \nfrom them … They look on the computer as an omnipotent God \nwhich can do no wrong and make no errors.’ More fundamentally, \nhe feared computer autonomy: ‘the computer companies are turning \nmore and more to ultra-sophisticated computers …which they hope \nwill develop a sense of reasoning … for me this is too much – \ncomputers programming computers’ (Matusow, 1968b: 23). Underpin-\nning these objections was a more general hostility to the computational \nmode. Matusow feared computers would bring a ‘pure, clean and \nsterile world’, introducing modes of uniformity and systematization, \nand that they would undermine the individual, threatening their \nautonomy, and remaking them. People would be retro-fitted to \nconform to programming needs rather than the other way around \n(Matusow, 1968b: 23). If one feared outcome was machinic individu-\nals, the other concern was that people would become the human \nindividual the computer declared them to be. Matusow often returns \nto the consequences of computer error, concerned that assumption \n A most political performance  87\nof computational infallibility would entail the presumption of human \nfault, and also worried that errors made would be increasingly \ndifficult to correct. These concerns are repeatedly tied in to questions \nof reputation and identity: ‘if any information is incorrectly pro-\ngrammed into the machine, no one questions it – there is no recourse \nand a person’s reputation can be seriously hurt by an incorrect \ncomputer statement’ (Matusow, 1968b: 23).\nMatusow’s early anti-computing commentary was in journals. In \nthe mid-1960s he looked for a publisher for a book on ‘computer \natrocities’, to be light-hearted but with serious intent. The Beast of \nBusiness was published in 1968. It declared itself a ‘record of \n[computer] atrocities against the human race … and a guerrilla \nwarfare manual for striking back’. Matusow compiled and edited \n‘atrocity’ contributions, which were also solicited by the publishers.52 \nHe also wrote a framing essay declaring computerization an affront \nto human dignity, reducing freedom, introducing specific un-freedoms, \nand rendering societies into bureaucratic monoliths unable to escape \nthe ludicrous excesses of their own rule-makers.53 The Beast’s front \ncover declared:\nThe war is intensifying very rapidly. Be ready for its consequences. \nYou have little time before it engulfs you to learn to know that the \ncomputer is here and to show you that you know what its dangers \nare. At a moment’s notice you may be involved in a situation in a \ngovernment office, or with the police, your bank or a post office. In \nthat critical hour you will be alone and defenseless against the statistics \nand data which the machine pours out. You must be prepared. You \ncannot tell under what conditions and at what hour you may have \nto fight the machine. You want to know what is expected of you. \nYou must be ready for any eventuality. (Matusow, 1968a)54\nMatusow invited those interested in action against the threat of \ncomputerization to join his society (see e.g. Daily Mirror, 16 January \n1969). He was back in an organization, of a kind. This one was in \npart a media construct, although it was more than that. What it \nwas not was a ‘standard’ activist organization, nor was it attached \nto organized politics. Consonant with his affiliation to Oz, the society \nhad more to do with the counter-culture than the practices of the \nLeninist Left(s). In a letter to putative members (‘Dear Individual \n88 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\n…’), Matusow addressed the perennial (for revolutionaries) question \nof What Is to Be Done:\nShould we … organize mass demonstrations, march on IBM? I don’t \nthink so. If nothing else this is a cool organization. It’s the computer \nthat’s going to get short-circuited. It’s we who communicate. (October \n1969)55\nThe proposed theatre of disruptive and ‘cool’ activity extended from \nthe sphere of personal, into the social arena, and into the corporate \nworld. The society backed direct action of various kinds, from the \npedantic through the absurd, and on to potentially serious acts of \nsabotage. Society members were said to add extra holes to punch \ncards to disrupt automated personal bills and records processes. \nOther sabotage methods discussed were rubbing clear wax on the \nspace on forms designated ‘for official use only’. PHS in the Times \ndiary invoked the society’s suggestion that census forms should be \nthwarted by inserting ‘not legally competent to answer’ wherever \npossible, rather than obediently contributing to the exercise of data \ncollection. Getting into the spirit of things, PHS also suggested using \nthe OHID forms Matusow had generated for Oz (The Times, 15 \nApril 1971). Most of the activities discussed were more talked of \nthan undertaken. Sabotage, even that which was reported as already \ntaking place, was largely a rhetorical possibility.\nThe society’s most active and influential phase began when \nMatusow gave an interview on John Peel’s Nightride show (1969), \ndiscussing his fears about computer databases and the social world. \nThis produced a strong public response56 and was picked up by \nother press and TV organizations. Matusow fanned the flames, \ngiving interviews, writing letters to editors (e.g. to The Times, 24 \nAugust 1970, saying all errors are not human after all …).57 Reports \nfollowed in national publications, in the main more attracted by \nthe issue than the society itself. Dataweek was representative when \nit commented that the society, ‘though quite small’, was interesting \nbecause of the public response it had provoked.58\nPress reports on membership numbers of Matusow’s organization \nvaried. A column by Chris Ward in the Mirror (17 April 1969: 7),59 \nheadlined ‘How to Hit a Computer Where It Hurts’, announced \nthat ‘more than 5000 computers are now working for – or some \nwould say against – us in Britain and this number is increasing daily’. \n A most political performance  89\nWard noted that human opponents of computers were growing in \nresponse. He cited Matusow’s prediction that ‘very soon … numbers \n[of supporters] “will outnumber computers”’.60 An Evening Echo \nreport on 27 August 1970 by Jean Ritchie, headlined ‘It’s Them \nOr Us’, talked of ‘freedom fighting anti computer people’ and of \nan organization with 5,000 subscribing members.61 Later member-\nship figures quoted rose to 6,000 or 7,000 (although membership \ndatabases, particularly those of political organizations, are notoriously \nmassaged, as Matusow himself was abundantly aware).\nThe society claimed international tendencies. In response to a \nSunday Times article, Matusow pointed to a New Zealand chapter \nof ISADPM which declared itself a ‘computer control group’ (Atticus, \nSunday Times, 2 September 1969). There was some coverage in \ninternational mainstream media (e.g. the Sunday Herald, in Australia, \nnoted ‘Computer Hate Body Formed’ in September 1968, and the \nVancouver Sun covered the same story in 1969).62 There was also \nexposure in left and alternative presses outside the UK, e.g. in \nAutomatisme (Boribard, 1970).63 Managing the interest and the \nnumbers of contacts by hand was an issue. Ward notes that Matusow \nwas aware of the paradoxical nature of this difficulty: ‘what I could \ndo with, around here, he said, is a computer’ (17 April 1969: 7).64\nAppeal, reach\nThe appeal of the anti-computing league and its ideas was diverse. \nIt certainly linked into counter-cultural suspicions of the Machine, \nas Matusow’s work for IT and Oz attests to. It also attached to a \nMiddle England dislike of both modernization and ‘interference’ in \npersonal or intimate life. Finally, it attracted some computer profes-\nsionals; reviews of Beast of Business and reports on the society \nappear in various counter-cultural magazines/zines for data processor \nprofessionals. Real Time (strapline: ‘communication between computer \npeople’) included society coverage in Issue 2 and ran an editorial \nin Issue 3. Matusow himself claimed that:\nthere are over 50 IBM employees who are members of the International \nSociety for the Abolition of Data Processing Machines. Exactly what \nthey do to screw up IBM operations, they are not telling, but rest \n90 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nassured, they are doing their bit, and IBM high up executives have \ncause to lose some sleep.\nIBM apparently did not respond. It did, however, turn down a \nsuggestion that it should back the book; with his usual ethical \nflexibility Matusow had suggested this on the basis that it was more \nabout the need for ‘computer PR’ than an entirely hostile enterprise. \nIn a column in a business-to-business magazine Office Methods and \nMachines, he reprised this under the headline ‘The Computer Needs \na PR Man’ (May 1969: 14). 65\nAlthough the press ‘made’ the ISADPM, arguably it did so because \nit recognized that the ISADPM stance resonated with a structure of \nfeeling circulating in the UK at the time. Matusow made much of \nthe response he received after the Peel show, though he kept very \nfew of the letters he received in his archive. However, as an inveterate \npress clipper of his own work, he did archive discussions appearing \nin the press of the public’s response to his book. In ‘Computers \nUnder Fire’, an article for an issue of New Scientist specifically \nexploring computers and society, Rex Malik, 66 a ‘free-lance writer \nin computer sciences’, suggests that the ‘prolific flow of letters to \nMr Harvey Matusow’s ISADPM … reflects the widespread irritation \nand distrust generated by computers’ (Malik, 1969: 292).\nSome of the letters are abject: ‘Dear Mr Matusow, I would like \nto help wreck computers. Yours sincerely’. Amongst those Malik \ncites are letters from people with no engagement with computing, \napparently unnerved by their proximity to them; one letter writer \nannounced that ‘[t]he University of Essex is a stronghold of computers \nand I dislike them greatly’. (Malik, 1969: 292). Many critiqued the \nassumption that ‘it must be true, it came out of the computer’, and \nMalik also highlighted explicit fears about computer use ‘in the \norganization of people without social control’; writer after writer \nfears ‘we might hand over too much to the machine’, as one of the \ncorrespondents put it. Malik suggested the letters reflected ‘an \nundercurrent of fear about the computer and its effects among the \npopulation at large’. The fears they express include concerns raised \nby Matusow directly – particularly his concern that ‘those who do \nnot fit in well with the assumptions of a system could be mistreated \nby it’. It seems clear that the unclassifiable Mr Matusow, the man \nwith twelve lives, would himself fit into this category. Malik’s \n A most political performance  91\nsummation was that, ‘despite the absurd title of his society … \n[Matusow] … tells of a kind of nightmare – where a computer \noutcasts a man – which cannot be ignored … ’.\nReviews of Beast of Business  in the mainstream and business \npress varied. Banker’s Magazine excoriated the book as having ‘all \nthe attractions of a kind of computer Powellism …’, 67 arguing that \nwhatever Matusow’s own more existential or radical position, the \ngeneral public was exercised about computers largely around \nconsumer issues. Kinder reviews also suggested that much of the \ndissent Matusow had tapped into amounted to concerns around \nthe intrusive nuisance of direct mail. The Sun, introducing Matusow \nas the man ‘punching holes in computers’, did not question his \nideological objections to computers, but reported on practical issues \nconcerning automation and the threat to local post offices. (Richard \nLast, Sun, 3 May 1969: 5).68 There is little about industrial sabotage, \nnor the military industrial complex, mentioned in these more popular \nmainstream accounts. There was a tendency to agree that Matusow’s \nattack ‘with humour’ (The Office, August 1971: 30–34) belied a \nmore serious intent. An Observer ‘Pendennis’ column reported on \nMatusow’s call to ‘Worry a Computer, Confuse a Computer, Wreck \na Computer’, alongside a picture of the man (the suits of the HUAC \ndays disappeared as the young man of the 1950s became the 46-year-\nold hippie). It noted that, despite his peccadillos, including his \npenchant for the Jew’s harp and for collecting taxis, he was ‘more \nserious than you might think – at least on automation’.69\nElsewhere the society’s aims were represented in more politicized \nways. In the alternative press what was elsewhere described as a polite \nlament for the increasingly bureaucratic management of everyday \nlife (good bill payers thwarted) produced a more thoroughgoing, \nif indirect and often surreal, attack on bureaucratic structures and \ntheir logics of total or permanent capture. Volume 2 of Real Time \nmagazine70 discussed anti-computing in an editorial and previewed \na forthcoming issue on Matusow and the society with the bald \nquestion ‘are computers any use whatsoever?’ Reviewing the Beast \nof Business, it declares, more or less approvingly, that it will explain \nhow ‘[T]he computer is there to serve you, not to be your master. It’s \na guerilla warfare manual for striking back at the creeping menace \n… From it you can learn how to de-magnetize your cheques, add \nmillions to your computerized bank statement, get ten tons of broken \n92 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nbiscuits delivered to people you don’t like and generally how to \nworry, confuse, and wreck a computer.’ 71 Volume 3 does not appear \nin the archive – and may not have materialized.\nThe ease with which the society fitted itself into all these various \norgans suggests its founder’s continuing ideological flexibility. Its \nBoard included musician Anna Lockwood (then Matusow’s wife) \nand individuals from Wolfe, the publishers of the ‘anti-computer \nbook’.72 Clearly, the society, whatever else it was designed to do, \nalso functioned simply as a marketing tool for the book. Other PR \nwork was done too; the archive contains press shots of Harvey \nstrangling, or being strangled by, tape in front of the reel-to-reel-like \ncases of a bank of computers.73\nIn finding the anti-computer cause, Matusow had arguably found \na new ‘gimmick’ and was setting out to exploit it. Once again, in \na new and much diminished sphere, he became an ‘expert’ witness \nand dined out on this activity.74 He became known as an author -\nity, speaking for the anti-computing ‘side’ in many debates around \ncomputerization, databases, and society. He was eschewed by some \nfor his populism and obvious showmanship. IBM not only didn’t \nback the book but declined to accept him as a spokesman in a debate \nabout computers and society, stating that his involvement would not \nbe at a ‘worthwhile level’ (Sunday Times, 9 January 1972: 32). 75 \nHowever, he attended other events where the debate was serious \nand sustained, including, for instance, a National Council for Civil \nLiberties forum on civil liberties and the ‘Databank Society’,76 and his \nviews were taken seriously by various MPs and politicians, including \nsome involved in discussions around computerization and databases \nin relation to Kenneth Baker’s 1969 Bill on Right of Privacy.\nA consistent thread in the writing of Matusow at this period \nconcerns exoneration. He repeatedly expresses a fear and a belief \nthat the computerized collection of data on human individuals is a \none-way street; once in, never out. The difficulty of deletion for \nthose named on a list was also of course integral to the blacklisting \noperations of the McCarthy era (as it was, as Miller had noted, to \nthe witch-hunts of Salem). Matusow saw the same dynamic threaten-\ning to return via computerization – where it would also become a \ngeneral condition, and one that might, by virtue of its superior \ncollecting capacity, be far more absolute. He feared that the computer \nindustry might ‘like Moby Dick’ swallow us whole.77\n A most political performance  93\nThe end of ‘anti-computing’ …\nIf it happened, we didn’t notice. Or perhaps we are in the belly of \nthe beast. This early anti-computing moment, with its focus on the \nconsequences of data capture and storage for personal freedom had \nfaded by the mid-1970s. Computers became ubiquitous in offices, \nworking with them was far more routine, and gaming arrived, in \nthe UK at least, in the early 1980s (see Haddon, 1988), offering a \ndifferent mode of interaction. At around the same time the personal \ncomputer was introduced, undermining for the moment visions of \nthe centralized database society and explicitly challenging the IBM \nmodel of computation. Paradoxically, this challenge came from \nApple, responsible for one of the most successful closed computing \nsystems ever launched. In another paradox, one of the legacies of \nthe underground press with which Matusow was involved was the \nrise of listings magazines (e.g. Time Out). As for the Beast, it went \nout of print and is now available only second hand through various \nonline outlets. As one seller wryly comments, this in itself ‘proved \nwe lost’.78\nMatusow himself left England. In his later years he spent time \nin austere low-tech communities in the US. Kahn tells us he was at \ntimes without even electricity. He did later revise his anti-computing \nstance, surfacing rather early on the web as Job Matusow, via a \nwebsite called CockyBOO, which appears to be an attempt at a \ncooperative biography. Matusow died during its construction and \nthe page became an early example of digital memorialization. The \ntributes there are often rather affectionate. They are for Job (Harvey) \nMatusow and are largely read by the odd few curious and uncertain \nonlookers, circulating around a now dead but still unfixed identity \n– ‘are you the same Matusow?’ one asks.\nMatusow could be dismissed as a man entirely without consistency \nwhose anti-computing activities were only a peculiar footnote in a \nlife whose activities had been significant on a far larger stage. What \nhas been argued here is that Matusow’s hostility to the computational \ndatabase and its operations, his concern with the relationship between \nthe computer record and its operationalization, his focus on how \nwhat is collected is put to work, all find echoes in his earlier activities. \nSo, if understanding ‘the truth’ of his motivations is impossible, not \nleast because these motivations shift and dissolve, then we can note \n94 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nthat his ambiguous relation to media, to the spectacle, but above \nall to the record, is remarkably consistent in its ambiguity. It is \ncharacteristic that more than once he declared his dislike for technol-\nogy, and computer technology, in magazines dedicated to their \npromulgation.\nConclusion 1: culpability\nTo explore the onion layers of Harvey Matusow’s history is to \nbecome aware that his most constant trait was a constant tendency \ntowards constant revisionism. This appeared to be enabled by a \nsense that his version of events could have credibility or force, even \nif demonstrably not true – something that now looks horribly familiar, \nparticularly in relation to political leaders. Decades later, in an \ninterview and report by David Madison (1998) from filmvault.com, \nMatusow represents himself as a peculiar kind of hero, rewriting \nhis informing activities one more time to suggest he was ‘toying \nwith Congress and the country’s salivating media … telling a string \nof outrageous lies that McCarthy and the others never questioned’. \nThis is at one with other moments in which he appears to be revising \nhis recantation story.79 Perhaps, after terminal exposure, and after \nhis activities to expose others, and finally in the light of this late \nand disgraceful attempt at exculpation, he deserves oblivion. What \nseems more productive, however, is to observe the threads and events \nof his life, to understand that this engagement with the monstrously \nmiscommunicating systems of the McCarthy era made him somebody \nopposed to database power, who understood databases as the powerful \nmeans through which people might be engulfed by large corporations, \norganizations, or states.\nConclusion 2: computer history\nMatusow’s story contributes to histories of the counter-cultural \nengagement with computer technologies. Antipathy to the Machine, \nthe latter nomenclature designating both a political system (nascent \nglobal capitalism and the post-war world) and the hard, technocratic \nrationality that characterized it, which was part of the broader \n A most political performance  95\ncounter-cultural formation, might be taken to include antagonism \nto the specifically computational. A series of histories of the personal \ncomputing industry in Silicon Valley and its virtual suburbs have \ndemonstrated that this history of alignment is more complex and \ncertainly more partial than is often suggested. Such works have \nexplored the diverse connections between the technology innovators \nand the counter-cultural movements of the 1960s and early 1970s \n(Levy, 1984, Cringley, 1996, Turner, 2006), and there is also the \nevidence of this to be found in Whole Earth Review (and perhaps \nin publications such as Ted Nelson’s Computer Liberation). Fred \nTurner’s work on Stuart Brand (the Whole Earth creator), for instance, \ntraces out how, albeit in relatively small circles, a shift ‘into’ computer \ntechnology was made.\nTurner accounts for what turned the US West Coast counter-\nculture towards digital technologies (what turned them on, techni -\ncally perhaps), what made them re-evaluate technologies that had \nbeen developed as part of military agendas (the early Cold War in \nparticular), and what led to the sustained engagement between the \ncounter-culture and the Valley; this is the shift from the Whole Earth \nto Wired via Stuart Brand. The Matusow case suggests an alternative \nand supplementary trajectory exposing a form of engagement with \nemerging computer technologies in the late 1960s/early 1970s that \nis also essentially counter-cultural, but that did not follow a trajec-\ntory from hostility (to computer technology as military technology \nor the technology of the Man) to avidity. This is not necessarily \nbecause Matusow lacked the close technical relationship to computer \ntechnology that the hackers had, although he did lack that, since \nhis engagement in film and the visual and sonic arts was analogue. \nRather, what seem significant are his experiences of databases in \noperation, and in operation in specifically political contexts. This \nperhaps led both to his hostility to computers and to a more mate-\nrial series of objections to computerized culture than those arising \nsimply from a principled objection to the (abstract) Machine, based \non a general critique of technocratic culture. By the 1960s he was \nalready an expert, not in computer circuitry but in the potentially \ndevastating effects of particular forms of instantiated database  \noperation.\nThe historical context of the mid- to late 20th-century information \nsociety debates was the Cold War, as it developed in the 1940s and \n96 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nthe 1950s, and its permanent security imperatives (see e.g. Edwards, \n1996). Turner’s account considers how, in certain areas, this early \nconditioning (the fashioning of technology as weaponry) was \novercome (tactically perhaps) as the technologically savvy turned \n(retuned) technology to their own (counter-cultural/later commercial) \nends. In this way a counter-culture became a Wired culture. Matusow, \nwho experienced the Cold War not through close-up engagement \nwith its technologies but through close-up engagement with its \npolitical operations, the anti-communist America of the late 1940s \nand 1950s,80 comes to take a different view. Specifically, he was \ninterested in what might be termed, drawing on Latour, the obduracy \nof the categorizing operations that the computerized sort could \nundertake. Computerization is for him often an atrocity (even though \nhe is also not entirely against it), and it is clear in fact, reading his \npapers, that his sense of why it is an atrocity comes from his \nunderstanding of how it might be used as a social weapon. After \nall, he has himself been caught up in the use of databases, and the \nuse of data entry, storage and retrieval, to these ends.\nConclusion 3: media archaeological witnessing?\nJohn Durham Peters, cited above, explores witnessing as a common \n‘but rarely examined’ term in both professional and academic analysis \nof media events. For Durham Peters, witnessing raises questions of \n‘truth and experience, presence and absence, death and pain, seeing \nand saying, and the trustworthiness of perception – in short funda-\nmental questions of communication’. He also views the witness as \ntaking on responsibility so that ‘[t]o witness an event is to be in \nsome way responsible to it’ (Durham Peters, 2001: 707–708). Durham \nPeters moreover articulates his discussion in medium terms, talking \nof witnesses as a ‘fallible transmission and storage mechanism’ \n(Durham Peters, 2001: 710). Carrie Rentschler, following Durham \nPeters, develops his sense that the witness is also a medium, and \nthe medium can constitute a form of storage space for witnessed \nmaterial (Rentschler, 2004).\nFor Durham Peters, ‘in the moral sense: to witness means to be \non the right side’ (Durham Peters, 2001: 714), because witnessing \nis a ‘mode of communication’. Matusow, in the witness stand, is in \n A most political performance  97\nthis sense not witnessing at all. The storage mechanism named Harvey \nMatusow was thus falsely understood as witnessing. This mechanism \nis both the man and the medium; the camera apparatus and the \napparatus of the hearings. Testimony and technology are related. \nIndeed, as Durham Peters notes, drawing on Shapin, it was modern \nscience that overcame ‘the low repute of testimony’. Writing of \nmodest witnessing Donna Haraway makes a similar argument \n(Haraway, 1997). Both note that it is because of science and its \ninstruments that testimony came to be trusted: ‘thing-like, and hence \ncredible’ in its indifference to human interests.\nThe camera and the microphone both inherit this tradition of \nobjectivity as passivity, says Durham Peters. They produce a form \nof assumed credibility and reliability that finds its way into court \n– that is, ‘[l]egal rules prefer a mechanical witness’. Durham Peters \ngoes on to argue that ‘[T]he ideal human would behave like a \nthing: a mere tablet of performing’, a ‘dumb witness’ who has no \nmotive to ‘lend comfort’ (Durham Peters, 2001: 715–716). In the \nend, it might be this, the threat that computing could turn human \nsociety into something automated so that it is run by a system with \nno motive to ‘lend comfort’, that the later Matusow, informed by \nhis own experiences as a storage mechanism, the witness with the \ncamera, the speaker with the microphone at the hearing stand, came  \nto hate.\nThese final observations on history, the database, and the witness \nconnect. They constitute three sites in which this media archaeology \nproduces a reappraisal, a new possible route to understanding. To \nstress, these are not replacement ‘causal chains’ (say for some entirely \nother reading of the counter-culture and its technological orientation), \nnor is this an ‘escape into history’ (Huhtamo and Parikka, 2011: \n4). What I am driving at is the restitution of under-emphasized \ncontinuities and connections, and a rethinking of computing and \nits ongoing and historical insertion into a mediated world. In his \naccount of what he always refused to term media archaeology, \nZielinski set out to understand (far) earlier forms of media and \nmedia work. He did so through what he describes as works of \n‘praise and commendation’ (Huhtamo and Parikka, 2001: 11). I \nhave no commendation, but would not wish to condemn, since it \ndoesn’t seem productive. The intention has been, rather, to work \nthrough a life history, viewing it as a matter of collection, storage, \n98 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nand retrieval, not to reduce it to its essentials, nor let it stand for \nan entire moment, but to understand it more fully.\nNotes\n1 In 2013, Edward Snowden, a Central Intelligence Agency employee and  \nsub-contractor leaked classified information from the National Security \nAgency to The Guardian and The Washington Post. The thousands of \nleaked documents revealed the extent of the mass surveillance programme \nin the US and produced fierce debate around freedom, digital surveillance, \nand privacy.\n2 A column in the Daily Mirror, 17 April 1969 by Chris Ward notes that \nthere are 5,000 computers in the UK and around the same number of \nmembers joining Matusow’s society [MC Box 21].\n3 From Matusow and Malik draft [MC Box 21/2c], and in The Beast of \nBusiness, a Record of Computer Atrocities (Matusow, 1968a).

See e.g. a flyer for ‘Harvey \nMatusow “it can happen here”’, a lecture at the Libertyville Community \nSunday Evening Club (5 October 1952), which claims ‘Matusow’s \nlectures answer the question … “how can our young boys and girls \nbecome Reds?”’ [MC Box 6/3, 6/4].\n19 [MC Box xi].\n20 [MC Box 6/2].\n21 [MC Box X (h)].\n22 A ‘Clark H.

Oz 28 is part of the Matusow \ncollection.\n32 Information packs for the defence of Oz declare it to be ‘constitutionally \nincapable of facing a solemn fun free future … cutting cane beneath \nsome Spartan banner of liberation’. A flyer for the Independence Day \nCarnival, Sunday 4 July, Hyde Park, in the run-up to the Oz trial tells \nthe same story (see also Oz, December 1969 issue). Much of Matusow’s \nlater writing tunes with Oz’s attempt to slip between consumer capital \nand the rigidities of orthodox left politics [MC Box 37/3].\n33 See also Matusow on Neville and medium form in a draft review \nof Richard Neville’s 1970s Playpower, submitted to IT magazine. \n‘McLuhan is dead – long live Neville, who has found a new way \nto use words in a book – he writes with his eyes’ [MC Box 37, MC  \nBox 49/6].\n34 A  copy of the School Kids issue of Oz (issue 28) is in the collection – as \nare separate copies of the Human Dignity forms [MC Box 37].\n35 A draft script was prepared for a ‘New Horizons’ or ‘alternative society’  \ndocumentary project to involve Matusow and Neville. Neville’s comments \non the televisual are included here [MC Box 49/6]. Others were also \ninvolved in questioning media and mediums and Matusow was well \naware of them. The collection includes the first issue of Cinemantics \n(1970), striking for artist Malcolm Le Grice’s (1970) article on television, \neffectively a pre-emptive demand for a (utopian version of) an internet \nfor the people [MC Box 49/13].\n36 Predictions are interesting.

An exploration of the stakes of the early \ncybernation debates opens up questions about the end of work that \nfind new salience today. Exploring Arendt’s work in these contexts \nsheds fresh light on her analysis of ‘a labour society approaching \nits end’ (Lenz, 2005: 135). It is thus also to reassess how Arendt’s \nthinking on technology travels.\n* * *\nCybernation at last forces us to answer the historic questions: ‘What \nis man’s role when he is not dependent on his own activities for the \nmaterial basis of life’? (The Ad Hoc Committee on the Triple Revolution \n[Agger et al.], 1964).\nMan cannot be free if he does not know he is subject to necessity, \nbecause his freedom is always won in his never wholly successful \nattempts to liberate himself from necessity. (Arendt, 1998: 121).\nOn a hot two days in June 1964 1 an unlikely group, including \ncomputer scientists, engineers, philosophers, political scientists, a \nfeminist, civil rights activists, theologians, government workers, and \nadministrators, Labour leaders, entrepreneurs, and a Left hero once \naccused of spying, assembled at the Hotel Madison in New York \n106 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nCity for the First Annual Conference on the Cybercultural Revolution \n– Cybernetics and Automation. Cost of attendance, paid in advance, \n$7.50. This gave entry to two events: the Cybercultural Revolution \nwas held back to back with the Third Annual Conference of the \nCongress of Scientists on Survival.2 The conference was convened \nby Alice Mary Hilton, a programmer and social activist, and engaged \nwith the ideas of the Ad Hoc Committee on Triple Revolution, a \ncoalition of the expert and the interested who saw in computerization, \nand particularly in cybernation – defined as the convergence of \nautomation and computerization (Michael, 1962) – the possibility \nof fundamental and radical social change. The Triple Revolution’s \nmanifesto identified ‘three revolutions underway in the world … \nthe cybernation revolution of increasing automation; the weaponry \nrevolution of mutually assured destruction; and the human rights \nrevolution’ (Boggs, 1963). Peace was the greatest prize, civil rights \nthe most pressing as a political demand, but the means identified \nto bring about change was cybernation (Agger et al., 1964).\nSpeakers and panellists at the Cybercultural Revolution conference \nexplored the displacement of human labour, managing the transition \nfrom human to machine labour, and the future prospects for the \nsociety of idleness or leisure to be inaugurated by computers. They \nset out to define and explore the technologies with which they were \ndealing, to consider the Evolving (present) and Future Society, and \nto explore global issues. They were speaking into a world changing \nvery rapidly; key contexts were the Cold War, the bomb, President \nJohnson and the ‘Great Society’ programme, the first formal successes \nfor the civil rights movements and the coming long, hot summers \nof the early to mid-1960s urban riots.3 These were also the years \nwhen mass consumption provided many in the US with a well-\nequipped home (Cowan, 1985), and when the first stirrings of \nfeminism’s discontents with what recompense automated domesticity \noffered women were felt (Friedan, 1963).4 Amongst these rapid \nshifts there was also the developing legacy of first-wave cybernetics, \nthe early expansion of computer machines into business and their \ncontinually shrinking footprint (in 1964 IBM launched its first \nnon-monolith computer), and the acceleration of automation through \nthe coupling of mechanized processes with computational technologies \nor ‘computer machines’ that enabled cybernetic systemization of \nproduction processes.\n No special pleading  107\nAmongst contributors to the conference was the philosopher \nHannah Arendt, whose typed conference paper ‘On The Human \nCondition’ is to be found in the Library of Congress along with a \nletter from Hilton chasing her for her copy. The paper also appears \nin Evolving Society, a conference proceedings publication edited by \nHilton (Hilton, 1966) which included the conference papers, panel \ndiscussions, chairman’s summations, and many contributions from \nthe floor. Arendt’s intervention was much anticipated by many \nattendees. Her presence was felt in other ways too; her thinking \ninfluenced Hilton’s organization of themes as well as the latter’s own \nwork (Hilton, 1964, and my personal interview). It was a key frame-\nwork through which the conference explored the potential risks and \nbenefits (and/or the good and evil aspects) of the fully cybernated \nfuture that many confidently anticipated would rapidly come about.\nThis chapter explores Arendt’s consideration of cyberculture as \nshe explored it in dialogue with these other voices, during the time \nof the ‘cybernation scare’ (Ganz, 1966), and asks how it reframes \nthemes found in The Human Condition, published in 1958. It draws \non Arendt’s paper,5 on The Evolving Society and the Triple Revolution \nreport. A key additional resource is an extended interview with \nAlice Mary Hilton which I conducted in New York in 2010, a few \nyears before her death (Hilton, 2010). Hilton was active around \ngroups interested in social justice and peace and was an inveterate \ndebater, described by one admiring reviewer as a ‘Socratic Gadfly’ \n(Riepe, 1967), and in a newspaper profile named as the ‘Velvet \nVoice of Automation’ (Sheehy, 1964). She was avowedly half in \nlove with Arendt, fascinated by the latter’s intellectual glamour, and \nengaged passionately with her ideas (Hilton, 2010).\nArendt’s brief paper to the Cybercultural conference, ‘On The \nHuman Condition’, might be dismissed as simply an out-take delivered \nin response to Hilton’s urgent solicitations. The context of the paper’s \ndelivery, however, as well as the specific form the arguments took, \nmakes it more than that. Arguments around the changing relations \nbetween labour, work, action, and the political life set out in print \nin the rarefied grounds of The Human Condition play differently \nin a live discussion between the peculiarly (‘incurably’) informed \nconference goers, who not only spoke for a series of different interests \nbut often embodied them. Elisabeth Young-Bruehl’s account of Arendt \nis of a ‘practical minded person’ who wanted ‘thoughts and words \n108 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nadequate to the new world … [who wanted to] dissolve clichés, \nreject thoughtlessly received ideas … hackneyed analysis, [to] expose \nlies and doubletalk’ (Young-Bruehl, 2006: 11). Arendt herself defined \npolitics as the ‘organization or constitution of the power people \nhave when they come together as talking and acting beings’ (Young-\nBruehl, 2006: 84). The conference was a place where her thinking \non what constituted the political came into contact with the messy \n‘real world’ which did not necessarily respect divisions important \nin her work.\nArendt’s presence at the conference also directs attention to her \nconsideration of the specifically technological, which is somewhat \nneglected in critical assessments of her writing which focus on her \nthinking on totalitarianism (albeit in its relationship to technocratic \nrationality); Arendt’s work is surprisingly rarely explored for what \nit says about technology ‘itself’.\nFinally, there is a way in which ‘On The Human Condition’, \nresponding to prospects that seemed imminent during the short \nperiod of the cybernation scare, operates on a slightly different time \nscale than The Human Condition . We might say it responds to a \nsubtly different conjuncture, to invoke Hall’s term (Hall, 1990, \nGilbert, 2019). The import of Arendt’s paper is that cybernation \nmay mark the surpassing of the victory of labour over work, and \nthe transmogrification of the latter into a mode of job holding \ncoupled with consumption, which is dealt with at length in The \nHuman Condition. What was explored as an extreme imbalance in \nThe Human Condition (Arendt, 1998, Lenz, 2005) becomes in the \nconference paper a terminal pathology.\nCybernation and the automation ‘scare’\nThere was, almost from the beginning, an awareness that computers, \non the one hand, and cybernetics on the other, would have major \nsocial consequences. Cybernetics was – as a systems theory – a \ngeneral theory, one claimed to have wide applicability for social \nprocesses as well as for mathematical and biological ones. The Macy \nconferences, one of the major early sites for exploring cybernetics, \nincluded alongside information theorists and mathematicians, social \nscientists, anthropologists, and others (Heims, 1991). Norbert Wiener, \n No special pleading  109\nwhose 1940s work on cybernetics helped found the field, understood \nnot only the potential use of cybernetics to model human systems \nbut also the difficulties and problems that might arise in the attempt \n(see Wiener, 1961, and Wiener cited in Hilton, 1966b). Amongst \nhis fears was mass upheaval as a consequence of automation’s effect \non jobs. Wiener thought decisions around the organization of a \ncybernetic society were urgent. His comment ‘the hour is very late, \nand the choice of good and evil knocks at our door’ (Wiener, 1989) \nwas much invoked at the conference; many felt the clock had ticked \ndown and the time of decision was at hand (Hilton, 1966: 144, \n385). They weren’t alone; by the early 1960s the impacts of cybernetic \nautomation were being felt in the US and the likely acceleration of \nthese impacts was being actively explored. Of particular concern \nwas an expected transformation of work of many kinds through \nthe combination of computers and ‘the automated self-regulating \nmachine’ (Winthrop, 1966a: 113).\nThe term cybernation was coined by the political scientist Donald \nN. Michael, in The Silent Conquest (1962), a report for the Centre \nfor the Study of Democratic Institutions. It was a designation intended \n‘to refer to both automation and computers’, being invented for \n‘convenience’ and to avoid the awkwardness of repetition (Michael, \n1962: 6). Michael believed cybernation would produce ‘a profound \ndifference in kind’. There was, he said, ‘every reason to be concerned \nwith the implications of thinking machines’, whose capabilities and \npotentialities were ‘unlimited’, and whose advent had ‘extra-ordinary \nimplications for the emancipation and enslavement of mankind’ \n(Michael, 1962: 9). His report begins ‘with the advantages of \ncybernation’ (Michael, 1962: 10), concluding that it is needed for \nthe survival of a democratic system, but goes on to consider problems \nlikely to arise – most immediately mass unemployment, suffered \nunequally so that dominated groups would bear the brunt of the \nend of work. Michael postulates the creation of four classes, one \ncomprising the entirely unemployed and one with no more leisure \nthan before – which ‘in the case of professionals means very few \nhours of leisure indeed’ (Michael, 1962: 29). This is followed by a \ndiscussion of publics, of public opinion, and of the threat to the \nindividual – who may be ‘completely swallowed up in statistics’. \nThe Silent Conquest is fearful for the future partly because the trajec-\ntory embarked upon appears unstoppable; Michael argues that there \n110 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\ncan be no ‘moratorium on cybernation’. In a discussion of life ‘after \nthe take-over’ he wonders gloomily how members of this new society \nwill occupy themselves – ‘even with a college education, what will \nthey do all their long lives, day after day, four day week after four \nday week, vacation after vacation, in a more and more crowded \nworld … What will they believe in and aspire to as they work their \nshorter hours, and … pursue their self-fulfilling activities whatever \nthey may be?’ (Michael, 1962: 45). The Silent Conquest is a peculiar \ndocument read from this distance, at once detailed and speculative, \nprescriptive and bewildered.\nOthers were considering similar questions. In England Sir Leon \nBagrit gave the BBC Reith Lecture series for 1964 on The Age of \nAutomation (Bagrit, 1965, Huhtamo, 1999: 1). In the US the Silent \nConquest gained some media traction; the New York Times (29 \nJanuary 1962), for instance, writing it up under the headline ‘Automa-\ntion Report Sees Vast Job Loss’, reported on fears of ‘vast unemploy-\nment and social unrest’. Erkki Huhtamo suggests that by the \nmid-1960s these issues were ‘widely debated as markers of a \ntechnological transformation which was felt to be shaking the \nfoundations of the industrialized world’ (Huhtamo, 1999). Huhtamo \nmight be overstating the case somewhat; there is some evidence that \nthose informed about these issues felt they were exceptions and that \nignorance amongst the general public was the general condition. \nWriting in 1964, Hilton comments, ‘this cybercultural revolution \n… is affecting the lives of millions of human beings who have never \neven heard the new words to describe powerful new concepts’ (Hilton, \n1964: 139, my italics). However, Winthrop notes that in more special-\nist arenas such as within social science and academic disciplines \nwithin the academy, around the labour movement, civil rights \norganizations, on the Left, within science and engineering, and in \nsome policy/government arenas there was informed (and ill-informed) \ndebate, perhaps even a ‘zeitgeist in which cybernation is seen as \nleading society toward a most important and critical juncture’ \n(Winthrop, 1996b: 117).\nThe Triple Revolution\nOne partisan report on cybernation that produced heat, if not, \naccording to its critics, light, was the Ad Hoc Committee’s Report \n No special pleading  111\non the Triple Revolution, already introduced. This was written by \n‘thirty-two prominent social critics and economists’ (Block, 1983: \n5),6 a mix of professional, academic, industrial, and labour movement \ncontributors including Alice Hilton (but not Donald Michael). \nContemporary readers noted resonances with J.K. Galbraith’s Affluent \nSociety (Galbraith, 1999, Block, 1983), and Hilton opened her paper, \n‘An Ethos for the Age of Cyberculture’ (1964), with a reference to \nGalbraith’s work. The Report was influential in setting out a liberal \nand left agenda for a post-work world and became a sounding board \nin cybernation debates. It found support but also provoked some \nhostility from the Right (and libertarian right), from sections of the \norganized Left, and from elsewhere. Notably, a theological objection \nwas raised by those feeling the loss of one of the essential components \nof the fallen human condition – ‘[the] in the sweat of thy brow shalt \nthou have earned thy bread labour and sustenance relation now \nbeing “cancelled”.’ (Schwartz, 1966).\nThe Report considered the possible combined impact on American \nculture and society of atomic technologies and the advent of unwin-\nnable war, computers and ‘the cybernation revolution’, and the \nhuman rights revolution. Their ‘simultaneous occurrence and \ninteraction’ meant ‘radical alterations in attitude and policy’ were \nnecessary, but it was cybernation and the end to ‘job holding as the \ngeneral mechanism through which economic resources are distributed’ \nthat could reorganize existing programmes for justice (civil rights) \nand for peace (an end to the nuclear threat), which last was regarded \nas the ‘supreme issue’. The Triple Revolution document was globally \nambitious in other ways too, linking questions of social justice and \nrights, and industrial automation and its social consequences arising \nin the US, to emerging social movements well beyond its borders, \nfor instance.7 It viewed cybernation as a mechanism that could \ntransform the logics of the market and the priorities of national \neconomies, which latter needed no longer to be ‘aimed far more at \nthe welfare of the productive processes than the welfare of people’. \nThe report acknowledged that cybernation was risky. Its signatories \nfeared violent social breakdown if change was not managed, and \nwere concerned that cybernation without planning could allow ‘an \nefficient and dehumanized community to emerge by default’. But \nthey were optimistic, arguing that ‘cybernation, properly understood \nand used, is the road out of want and toward a decent life’. Hilton \nthus prophesied ‘mutual destruction or a society of affluence and \n112 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nleisure’ (Hilton, 1964: 141). Alongside affluence there was also talk \nof freedom. As the Report put it, ‘cybernation at last forces us to \nanswer the historic questions: “What is man’s role when he is not \ndependent on his own activities for the material basis of life?”’ \nEchoes of that other Manifesto are clearly heard, and it becomes \nclear that the real prize, as it was in Marx’s original, is self-\ndetermination. The Report declares that ‘[a] social order in which \nmen make the decisions that shape their lives becomes more possible \nnow than ever before; the unshackling of men from the bonds of \nunfulfilling labor frees them to become citizens, to make themselves \nand to make their own history’.\nThe Triple Revolution was published in Liberation, presented to \nPresident Johnson (March 1964), and read in government circles. \nIts ideas were discussed in mainstream and specialist media, notably \nin ‘avant garde periodicals of ideas’, including specifically the Cor-\nrespondent, New University Thought, The Minority of One (Win-\nthrop, 1966a: 117). It was often received with some warmth and \nawarded serious attention in labour circles and circulated amongst \ncivil rights activists; it was on the curriculum at the Mississippi free \nschool camps for instance.8 Its propositions also percolated elsewhere; \nnotably, it features in Harlan Ellison’s 1967 iconic SF collection \nDangerous Visions by way of William Jose Farmer’s ‘The Riders  \nof the Purple Wage’, a dystopian take on a future leisure society  \nof staggering violence, banality, and inspiration. The report was \nunambiguously hated by some. Writing in the autumn of 1966, on \nWiener’s earlier prediction of imminent disaster, the libertarian Yale \nBrozen mocked ‘amateur social scientists such as Norbert Wiener’ \nfor his 1949 predictions of ‘a decade or more of ruin and despair’ \nas automation replaced jobs, and sneered that although the catas-\ntrophe appeared to have been retimed this hadn’t stopped the ‘doom \ncriers’ of the Ad Hoc Committee from suggesting the time of \nemployment would soon be over because ‘men cannot compete with \nthese machines’ (Brozen, 1966: 19).9\nCybercultural partisans? Key strands in the debate\nThe Conference on the Cybercultural Revolution was in large part \na Triple Revolution show. Many Report contributors (including \n No special pleading  113\nHilton, James Boggs, the civil rights and labour activist, and auto \nworker, Ben B. Seligman), presented or contributed. Some who were \ninvolved in the Institute for Cybercultural Research, which formally \nhosted Hilton’s event, were also signatories to the Triple Revolution \ninitiative. These overlaps indicated what Winthrop defined as the \n‘common convictions of the partisans of the coming age of cyber-\nculture’ (Winthrop, 1966a: 115).\nThe conference took up three key propositions of the Triple \nRevolution: that cybernation would come about, that it would change \nthe landscape of work and leisure, and that this would have deep \nsocial consequences for the present and future. Fierce debates arose \naround the extent and timing of disruption, how it might be managed, \nwho the beneficiaries and losers might be, what a new society might \nlook like, and how it might be ordered. A broader range of voices \nfrom the organized Left, labour organizations, academia, and industry \nwere heard, and also present were people from the new computer \nindustry, some Washington policy specialists, and at least one feminist \n– Betty Friedan was a discussant (Hilton, 1966).10 Finally, there was \nthe presence of Arendt, on the one hand, and of Donald Michael, \non the other. Arendt’s arguments are returned to in the final third \nof this chapter, but first the broad stakes of cybernation as they \nemerged at the conference are laid out.\nWork\nThe central issue was the revolutionary proposition that the means \nto live would soon be divided from the need to work. The implication \nof this shift, mass or majority unemployment in very short order, \nwhich was the Silent Conquest prediction, galvanized debate. The \nprospect of breaking this most basic connection, variously taken as \na biblical injunction, as the previously natural order of things now \nto be overturned, or as a particular industrial and political arrange-\nment, was returned to repeatedly. It was framed as a demand (by \nsome Ad Hoc Committee members), and variously as an intractable \nor resolvable problem; schemes for Living Certificates, essentially \nforms of Universal Basic Income, were invoked, for instance.\nDissent came from some ideologically wedded to work, seen as \nthe locus of the humanity and dignity of the individual ‘man’ (almost \n114 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nalways the ‘man’), and as central, in the form of organized labour, \nto societies’ hopes for more just futures. Notably, Victor Perlo, \nCP-aligned leftist (and hero of the McCarthy hearings), was adamant \nthat cybernation could produce new forms of work because wants \nand needs would increase with an acceleration in the capacity to \nproduce. He predicted new areas of exploration, given peace, ‘under \nthe earth and water, in space, in the biological health area …’ (Perlo, \n1966: 225),11 and looked forward to jobs not of the ‘grim old-\nfashioned kind’, 12 which might include computer programmers, \nastronauts, and development workers 13 (Perlo, quoted in Hilton, \n1966b: 236). Some dismissed this as wishful thinking. Maxwell \nGoldberg declared: ‘[T]he history of the interplay between technology \nand human labor is the history of the progressive displacement of \nsuch labour by labor saving devices invented by humans … the rest \nis commentary (Goldberg, 1966: 154).\nTiming\nThe timescale for widespread cybernation was disputed. Various \npresenters invoked economic analysis, presented empirical evidence \n(often disputed), or offered speculation based on expert knowledge \nin relevant domains – notably the nascent technical industries. Some \nidentified complacency around the likely rapidity of change, others \nargued that the velocity of cybernation was exaggerated; Paul Armer, \nof RAND, identifying himself as rather cautious, said the ‘cybernation \nof all production’ would happen, but added that men would still \nbe working for ‘at least two decades’ (Armer, 1966: 249).\nTransition\nThe conference explored cybernation and immediate disruption, \nand the transition to a fully cybernated society both together and \napart. Some who felt full unemployment was unlikely to arise in \nthe near future argued for a response framed within existing categories \n– around labour rights, or rights to work, and so forth. This included \ndemands for large-scale investment in public work programmes. \nNew schools, hospitals, and roads would create jobs, soaking up \n No special pleading  115\nthe newly unemployed and enabling society in general to reap the \nbenefits of automation. Tensions are evident between those considering \ncybernation’s effects on entire populations, and those considering \nit in relation to specific social groups and classes – the traditional \nworking class and organized labour, Black people, and women. The \nvarious perspectives of course depended on the situated position of \nthe speakers, and on their political commitments; Perlo’s position, \nfor instance, was founded on a belief that ‘capitalism and not the \nmachine’ causes mass unemployment. His calls for a planned economy \nand a ‘guiding of public interest by the builders of that life rather \nthan (by) the aristocracy of wealth’ (Perlo, 1966: 222) are consistent \nwith that. Accepting that cybernation would produce massive disrup-\ntion, he nonetheless argued that work neither ‘will’ nor ‘should’ \nbecome obsolete ‘this century’ 14 and was one amongst a group at \nthe conference demanding acknowledgement of the urgency of the \nday over speculation about possible futures (Perlo, 1966: 237). The \nAfrican American activist and auto-worker James Boggs,15 an Ad \nHoc signatory of the Triple Revolution report (Boggs, quoted in \nHilton, 1966b: 20), was for full cybernation and an end to wage \nlabour. He argued that rising unemployment would be felt first by \nthose whose experience of labour was of recent and brutal exclusion, \nthose who were already discriminated against in the workforce; \nAfrican Americans being ‘last in’ to many of the jobs in organized \nlabour, and then taking on ‘scavenger’ roles, would be first out \n(Boggs, 1966: 167). For Boggs, the dignity of labour, even labour \nitself, is less compelling when such labour does not offer benefits \n– or generate solidarity, without it having to be fought for. He thus \nargued that it was ‘wrong that so many people think that man must \nlabor and be punished in order to be permitted to exist’, adding, \npointedly, that it was no longer necessary for man to be a slave \n(Boggs, quoted in Hilton, 1966b: 243–244).\nBoggs nonetheless feared the violence of transition. He wasn’t \nalone. The philosopher and activist Grace Boggs also feared unrest, \nwhilst James Houghton of the National Association for the Advance-\nment of Colored People invoked the ‘real and immanent possibility \nof black and white workers fighting each other for jobs that are \nrapidly disappearing’ (quoted in Hilton, 1966b: 237). The difficulties \nof transition, and the virtual inevitability of the uneven distribution \nof the pain it would bring about, were key concerns of Donald \n116 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nMichael, expressed in the Silent Conquest, and in his paper and \ndiscussant interventions at the conference. These concerns about \ntransition led some – including James Boggs – to advocate very \nrapid change. Hilton too argued that it was important ‘to complete \ncybernation as quickly as is technically possible’ (Hilton, 1966b: \n152), to reach ‘the age of cyberculture’ (Hilton, 1966b: 150). This, \nshe said, would not solve, but might ‘resolve’, extant social issues. \nHer argument has striking parallels with contemporary accelerationist \nappeals to get out of trouble fast; it wasn’t only Hilton’s fear of the \nimmediate threat of a war from which ‘the earth may never recover \n…’ (Hilton, 1966b: 149), but a desire to accelerate away from \nexisting contradictions and social tensions that founded her position. \nThe focus on possible futures was, however, regarded as escapist \nby some, Perlo deriding those ‘taking refuge in talking of solutions \nfor the distant future’ and calling for concentration ‘on the tough \nquestions now’ alongside discussion of the ‘longer range’ but still \nproximate programmes he had identified (Perlo, quoted in Hilton, \n1966b).\nThe future society\nDespite objections, a large part of the Cybercultural conference was \ndevoted to exploring the possible future shape of an ‘Evolving Society’, \nand the burning question was how a ‘non-economic life’ might be \nlived. Leisure, politics, the arts, ways of living, and ways of being \nhuman, the latter including issues of memory, intelligence, happiness, \nand the good life – were all chewed over. Three striking features of \nthis debate, to which Arendt responded, are now explored.\nCultural renaissance figured largely. Harry Perks, a Californian \nsystems specialist, felt the 90 percent freed up from work would \nproduce ‘the goods of civilization … art, science, literature’. His \nperoration was a declaration for change: ‘I do not fear the leisure \nsociety. I am impatient for its arrival … livingry as an alternative \nto “overkill”’ (Perks, 1966: 196, 198). Hilton claimed the leisure \nsociety would see the flowering of new forms of cultural activity. \nTo which she added, with a nod to Arendt, a hope for the flowering \nalso of new forms of politics. To bring these things about many felt \n No special pleading  117\nthat a key would be education, not only to educate the newly freed \nsociety ‘into culture’ but also to bring ‘the people’ into new forms \nof considered citizenship. Some wondered how the newly unemployed \nwould use their time, and if they would find it productive in new \nways. James Boggs argued that African Americans were well posi-\ntioned for a cybernated society, already having experience of being \nthrust out of the working day. Betty Friedan invoked the experience \nof middle-class women and their lives of more or less involuntary \n‘leisure’ in the (newly technologized) home, and called for women \nto be allowed to fully share the benefits of universal cybernation. \nHer characterization of the fate of women as the involuntarily \ncybernated (it turns out the problem does have a name) possibly \nreveals her ambivalence to a society beyond work (Friedan, quoted \nin Hilton, 1966b: 317–318). Friedan, arguing for women’s perspectives \nto be taken into account, also noted that ‘most of you … are men \n… most of those who think about the cybercultural revolution are \nmen’ (Friedan, quoted in Hilton, 1966b: 62).\nA rather different debate centred on the post-human. In a euphoric \ncontribution Ted Silvey of the AFL/CIO (American Federation of \nLabor and Congress of Industrial Organizations) envisaged the \ncomputer as ‘a giant cerebellum’ on the ‘outside of the human head’ \ntaking care of billions of details to release the ‘higher elements of \nthe [human] brain’. This vision remained rather human in the end, \nsince it was said that cybernation would in this way begin the \nrealization of ‘man’s highest glory’ (Silvey, 1966). Others were more \nfearful. If the prize was a new and more positive existence, the fear \nwas that ‘sentient man’ would be replaced by the ‘compleat robot’ \n(Seligman, 1966: 166).\nThe third feature of this debate was the marked lack of critical \nconsiderations of consumption; for instance, around the constitution \nof artificial as well as real need in the future. The leisure society \nwas often envisaged as a society of plenty, in which all would be \nrich, and abundant goods would be freely available. For some this \nvision was almost pastoral: one bucolic vision of the cybernated \nlife was of rush baskets of goods picked up by happy humans \nfrom the end of robot production lines. Old forms of life would \ncontinue but some roles within them would be undertaken by \nmachines; the ease with which the roles to be replaced are named \n118 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nin raced terms (mechanical ‘slaves’ would replace human labour) is  \nstriking.\nMany were hopeful. If the end of work could be achieved without \nbloodshed and breakdown, an engaged society in which culture \nflourished, in which populations thrived, in which life could be good \nfor all, and the future glimpsed on the far horizon even better, could \nemerge. This leisure society utopianism was tempered for some: \nEdith Goodman, a discussant, wondered if post-cybernation life \nmight be as empty as the crowds happily queuing for heaven at the \nWorld Fair (Hilton, 1966b: 240).\nArendt and leisure\nArendt’s conference paper ‘On The Human Condition’, accepts \ncybernation as a fact, sets aside all matters of transition, and is \nmarked by a vision of the world beyond work that is very bleak \nindeed. ‘On The Human Condition’ does not dwell on the probable \ninjustice of transition into a cybernated society for already \ndiscriminated-against groups, raised in other papers. Arendt indeed \nadamantly refuses to deal in special pleading or to take up sectional \nor intersectional issues. She will not be sidetracked. There is no \nresponse offered to James Boggs’ concerns over the plight of those \nAfrican Americans ‘last in’ to organized labour and likely to be first \nout. Arendt instead sets out to ‘pose the problems from the point \nof view of the average citizen of the United States of America, not \nmembers of any specific class of the population ’ (Arendt, 1966: \n214, my italics).\nThe paper constitutes an utter rejection of romantic idealizations \nof a post-work society in which new forms of cultural life, and new \nforms of exalted humanity, may arise. Visions of art and poetry are \nscythed through. Arendt refused to offer her audience any hope for \na utopian society beyond the transitional period so many worried \nabout. Instead she argued that the presumed felicity of a life of \ncultured leisure freely consumed in a society beyond work was a \nchimera. Life for humans under conditions of full cybernation could \nwell be an empty, and endless, void. There is nothing automatically \nuplifting about the end of work; ‘we must not think that … culture \ncan just happen – when there is “free” time’ (Arendt, 1966: 217).\n No special pleading  119\nThe argument begins with a consideration of ‘intellectual activ-\nity, as such’, with rising machine capacity, and with the possibility \nthat machines could take over activities ‘identified as activities of \nthe human mind’ (Arendt, 1966: 214). Noting developments in \ncomputing, Arendt invoked chess computers as an example of the \ngrowing brain power of computers. Conceding that chess acuity \nmight be a measure of human intellectual acuity, she argues that \nit cannot be a measure of somebody’s qualifications ‘as a human \nbeing’. If machines can do something that has hitherto appeared to \nmark specifically human intelligence, then, says Arendt, the marker \nmust be changed for the sake of the ‘dignity’ of humans (which is \nnot at all the same as the dignity of labour); or, as I read this, in \norder that the human condition might continue to be recognized in \nits uniqueness in conditions of machine encroachment on formerly \nuniquely human capacities.\nArendt also briefly discusses the limits of computer memory, \ncommenting that humans also have a capacity to forget and to \nadjust, even to the loss of another, but that these two forms of \nforgetfulness are not the same. Whilst computers have storage capacity, \nhumans have a capacity for remembrance which does not come \nfrom a pre-existing substrate but is made (my italics) through action \nin the world, or in the public realm (see also Arendt, 1998: 208). \nThis has nothing to do with media storage, or ‘technical memory’ \n(Arendt, 1966: 215), indeed there is nothing of the machine about \nit. What come to be memorialized by humans are memorable actions, \nor worldly interventions. Arendt’s argument is that the human capacity \nto engage or act in the world – and the distinctively human capacity \nfor remembrance is only one part of this – is threatened by full \ncybernation and the world it may bring about.\nShe reads cybernation as a new development in transformations \nin the active life of humans over time. Here it is useful to turn to \ndistinctions drawn between labour, work, and action, as components \nof the active life (viva activa) in the Human Condition and to the \ndefinition of action in its properly political moment. A fully active \nlife is distinguished from labour (the sweat of the brow) and making \n(work undertaken on an object). The Industrial Revolution has \nalready replaced the craftsman or homo faber (who works) with \nthe socialized labourer distanced from tightly coupled circuits of \nlabour and reproduction, and without the ‘animal’ compensations \n120 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nthis could offer. Humans are already, and more than ever before, \ndistanced from the world – in refusing the valorization of labour \nArendt parts company with Marx.\nIn the conference paper Arendt argues that cybernation might \nproduce a further shift, and one more radical still. Entirely releasing \nhumans from their alienated labour would intensify their alienation \n– the term here implying an estrangement from any form of earthed \nor engaged life, an estrangement from that which conditions. This \nis explored first through adaptability. Arendt invokes her own \nexperience of technologically driven change – from ‘horse drawn \ncarriages’ to ‘credit cards’ in one lifetime, to consider adaptability \nand what it needs. Humans, she declares, are adaptable because of \nhow they are ‘conditioned by the world around them, the world in \nwhich, and with which they engage’.16 This ‘feed-back’ cycle is quite \nobvious, she says: ‘once the environment has really changed we are \nconditioned, even though we may know very little about the condi-\ntions that have moulded us’ (Arendt, 1966: 218).\nArendt’s fear is that human adaptability will fail in a fully cyber-\nnated society.\nLeisure/idleness\nThe reason is the nature of leisure society at the end of work, which \nArendt, drawing on Hilton’s term,17 explores in terms of ‘idleness’, \nsomething which ‘is ugly … [it] frightens us a little’ (Arendt, 1966: \n217). Lenz (2005) and Postel (2002) note Arendt’s sense that leisure \nis for stopping and thinking. A clear space is needed for the task \nof engaging in a ‘cooperative attempt to shape the world’ (see Hilton, \n1966b: 136). Against the Romans, who dealt with the idle life \nthrough bread and circuses, Arendt sets the Greek ideal of the citizen \n‘whose political tasks were so time-consuming he had neither vacant \ntime, or idle time’ (Arendt, 1966: 217). The busy cultural activities \nenvisaged as central to a post-work society will no more deliver this \nspace for leisure than what Hilton, exposing her class privilege, \ndisparaged as activities designed to fill idle days – beer and television \n– for those living almost completely private lives (Hilton, 1966b: \n149). For Arendt, hopes that a new society would remain ‘active’, \nthat ‘many creative activities and interests commonly thought of as \n No special pleading  121\nnon-economic would absorb the time and the commitment of many \nof those no longer needed to produce goods and services’ (the \naspirations of the Triple Revolution), were thus beside the point, \nor were working with an entirely different sense of what might \nconstitute the active life.\nWhy could leisure not be used in precisely the pursuit of the \npolitical activity of which she talks? In her paper Arendt considers \nthe ‘laborless strata of human society’ (Arendt, 1966: 217). She \nremarks on the difficulty traditionally privileged groups have found \nin handling leisure, ‘afraid of deteriorating in their complete freedom’ \n(Arendt, 1966: 218). Given this difficulty, the aspiration (aired at the \nconference) that freed from labour all shall ‘be able live on so high \na level’ seems to her unrealistic. She appears to believe that there is \nnothing to be learned from the experience of groups systematically \nexcluded from work. To Friedan’s intervention, ‘Half the population \nis now living in the cybercultural era … Will you let women in?’, \nand to James Boggs and others fearing an immediate future of \nincreased race discrimination and violence, but also arguing that \nAfrican Americans have experience of precarity, she has little to \nsay.18 Certainly, she does not align with those who see the leisure \nsociety as a form of restitution for past injustice or pain.\nArendt’s argument is that leisure is required for properly political \naction but is neither easeful nor easy to handle. A world beyond \nlabour and work, in which the vast majority are condemned to \nidleness, will condemn that majority to an existence filled with \n‘vacant time’ (Arendt, 1966: 217). Worse, in a cybernated world \nthis may be a permanent condition, since in this vacancy, or vacuum, \nthis place neither offering labour nor leisure, there are no conditioners, \nno traction, no gears to engage or call forth action, or enable adapta-\ntion, not even the residual forms of engagement found in earlier \nforms of industrial labour. Public life is stripped away. The world, \nwhich conditions, which produces adaptability, and which provides \ngrounds across which action is called forth, disappears; ‘For vacant \ntime is not a conditioner. Vacant time is nothingness’ (Arendt, 1966: \n218, my italics). In The Human Condition work is done to ‘decon-\nstruct the aura of necessity that surrounds all thinking about labour’, \nargues Lenz (2005: 139); the conference paper makes clear that, \ndespite that, labour is necessary – in that it is what remains of the \nviva activa. Without it there is nothing (again a vacuum). This is \n122 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nwhy, for Arendt, this life without work may be a move into a sort \nof death, an inhuman condition. In these circumstances it is hard \nto envisage how something new may emerge or be born. It is possible \nthat the human species, adaptable though it has always been, may \nnot be able to adapt to vacant time.\nThere is a strong commitment in Arendt’s work to the idea that \n‘action is open to all people’, being ‘rooted in the condition of being \nborn’ (Arendt, 1998: 86), and being therefore a universal possibility \n(Young-Bruehl, 2006). Politics is defined as action, as ‘a practical \nproject, a shared concern of citizens, and Firer Hinze notes Arendt’s \n‘passionate commitment to the concrete’ (Firer Hinze, 2009: 29). \nMany at the Cybercultural conference had a different sense of practical \npolitics. The response to Arendt’s line of thinking suggests that they \nwere at once beguiled and repulsed by her views. The perceived \nelitism of Arendt’s discussion of who could ‘handle’ leisure certainly \ndisturbed. Even Alice Hilton noted, rather dryly, that leisure was \napparently always one of those things that somebody else couldn’t \nhandle. Arendt’s refusal to take on board the sectional claims and \nappeals of particular groups also nonplussed some, although it is \nconsonant with Arendt’s divisions between the properly political \nrealm and the social sphere.\nParallels might be drawn with Arendt’s controversial intervention \naround desegregation battles in Little Rock, 19 where she criticized \nparents of the school children attending White schools for mistaking \nthe proper grounds of action. Making this intervention, she presumed \nher own underlying sympathies and affiliations were clear, when \nfor many her comments placed her on the wrong side of the fight \n(see Firer Hinze, 2009). Anne Norton comments that ‘in relation \nto Little Rock, the uneasy fit between her writings on race and her \ndisavowal of complicity in an unjust racial order shows the danger \nof taking one’s sympathies for granted’. (Norton, cited in Gines, \n2009: 73). Perhaps at the Cybercultural conference Arendt also took \nher general political orientation as read and, as in ‘Little Rock’, this \nwasn’t necessarily as clear as she believed. But the parallel to be \nmade is also that in both cases what is at issue (for Arendt) is the \nrelationship between the sphere of politics and the sphere of society, \nthe latter defined as ‘that curious, some-what hybrid realm, between \nthe political and the private in which, since the beginning of the \n No special pleading  123\nmodern age, most men have spent the greater part of their lives’ \n(e.g. Arendt, 2003: 205, cited in Firer Hinze, 2009: 46).\nArendt’s fear of the leisure society is that this hybrid realm is all \nthat there is. For her there is nothing in the life of leisure arriving \nin the wake of cybernation, a transformation dealt with not in \neconomic terms but essentially as a coming ontological condition \nthat is going to make it easier to act, or to act politically, or become \nor remain, fully active citizens. Instead, ease is part of the problem. \nArendt writes in The Human Condition that:\nThe easier that life has become in a consumers’ or laborers’ society, \nthe more difficult it will be to remain aware of the urges of necessity \nby which it is driven, even when the pain and effort, the outward \nmanifestations of necessity, are hardly noticeable at all. The danger \nis that such a society, dazzled by the abundance of its growing fertility \nand caught in the smooth functioning of a never-ending process, \nwould no longer be able to recognize its own futility – the futility of \na life which ‘does not fix or realize itself in any permanent subject \nwhich endures after [its] labor is past.’ (Arendt, 1998: 135)\nThis is where memory (human, collective memory) and the viva \nactiva coincide. We might see this lack of capacity to make history \nas a form of presentism.\nExergue: the human condition and technological  \ncondition of the world\nArendt is widely read as a political theorist and a critic of modernity \n(see e.g. Canovan, 1998: vii–viii). Consonant with this the classification \nof the activity of life through the categories of labour, work, and action, \nand the examination of changing hierarchies between them as they \nemerge in the mid-20th century constitutes the central material of The \nHuman Condition. But what is the place of the technological in The \nHuman Condition? In the work’s critical reception certain registers \nthrough which technology is taken up have been rather neglected. \nIn Young-Bruehl’s account The Human Condition is subsumed into \nArendt’s larger body of work on political totalitarianism. Others also \nnote that technology and totalitarianism are tightly (‘organically’) \nlinked in many of Arendt’s works (Canovan, 1998: xi). Attention \n124 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nis thus drawn to Arendt’s thinking on technocratic rationality as \nthat which might tend towards destroying politics, and this might \nbe a definition of totalitarianism as a form of government (and see \nYoung-Bruehl, 2006: 39). Less attended to is Arendt’s more specific \nconsideration of questions concerning technology and technological \ninnovation. Symptomatically, there is no entry for technology in the \nindex to Benhabib’s authoritative edited collection on Arendt, Politics \nin Dark Times (Benhabib, 2010: 4).\nIn her introduction to 1998 edition of The Human Condition \nMargaret Canovan noted the dialectical relation it entertains between \ntwo ‘strangely unconnected’ events: the flight into Space and the \nadvent of automation (Canovan, 1998: x). It begins with Sputnik’s \nrise and ends with the invention of the telescope, a rather beautiful \ninversion of archaeologically feasible causality in itself. Considering \nthese technologies and connections that are drawn between them \nprompts a reading of The Human Condition as an account of \ntechnological change, which is not quite the same as reading Arendt \nas a philosopher of technology (see Melis Bas, 2013), but is rather \nat odds with accounts that subsume questions concerning technology \ninto questions concerning technocratic rationality only.\nTo start, then, not with rationality but with action: Arendt argued \nthat the viva activa rises with the modern age in relation to the \nevent of technology, that is, the invention of the telescope, an event \nthat does not stand squarely inside the modern age but is at its \nopening. This event came quietly, as compared with the ‘spectacular’ \ndiscovery of ‘unheard of continents and un-dreamed of oceans’ \n(Arendt, 1998: 249), and was less initially disturbing than other \nevents (the Reformation). However, the ‘tentative steps’ it enabled \ntowards the discovery of the universe increased in momentousness \nand ‘speed’, eclipsing the enlargement of the Earth and its subsequent \nshrinkage through mapping processes (Sputnik and the view from \nSpace comes back in). The telescope offered ‘demonstrable fact’ \nwhere before there had been inspired speculations, those of Bruno, \nnotably (Arendt, 1998: 260). Paradoxically, this produced not \nexaltation but doubt – Cartesian doubt, addressed by a new reliance \nonly on what the self can know. But ‘it was not reason but a man-\nmade instrument, the telescope, which actually changed the physical \nworldview, it was not contemplation, observation and speculation \n No special pleading  125\nwhich led to the new knowledge, but the active stepping out of \nhomo faber, of making and fabricating’ (Arendt, 1998: 257–263). \nThus, if there is a growing reliance on self-made entities of the mind, \nmathematics, and knowledge that may be tested through more doing \n(the experiment), the real reversal, says Arendt, is between thinking \nand doing, and where thinking (philosophy) continues to demand \nself-inspection, the latter always demands more. The alternatives \noffered are ‘redoubled activity’ or ‘despair’ (Arendt, 1998: 293).\nThis furnishes a consideration of the rise, within the viva activa, \nof the Homo faber, or making man, and then the defeat of the \nHomo faber, or the general ascendency of labouring – giving homo \nlaborans. Homo faber involves an engagement with the world through \nobjects, but there may be a moment of contemplation within the \nprocess of making. As Arendt puts it, the arms fall and the ‘beholding \nof the model’ takes place (1998: 303). This, the craftsman’s differently \n‘contemplative glance’, she says, came to be known by many even \nwhilst the other form of contemplation, that of philosophy, was \nknown only by the few. But even this form of contemplation is said \nto be at risk.\nThe trajectory here follows two lines. First there is an exchange \nin priorities so that the concept of process rises over the concept of \nbeing (Arendt, 1998: 296). Eventually fabrication is understood \nentirely in terms of the former, and in this move, from ‘product’ to \nthe ‘process’ (Arendt, 1998: 304), contemplation loses its position \nin the viva activa and in ‘ordinary human experience’ (Arendt, 1998: \n304). Second, in this new world the principle of labouring expands \nout of the realm of the reproduction of life to become far more \nwidely operational. Labour brings with it the same unworldliness, \nor privatized existence that it had when confined to the more strictly \nor literally private life of reproduction. For Arendt this is unworldly \nbecause it presumes that what humans share is not the world, but \nshared or same nature. Moreover, when labouring, intrinsically \nunworldly, rises in this world, it brings with it a Benthamite ratiocina-\ntion of measured happiness that is some distance from the forms \nof making that have their eye on the object made (and in this way \nmay also contain a moment of contemplation), and is even further \nfrom action – which would not be measured or gauged in such a \nway at all.\n126 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nThis is accelerated (as part of processes of automation, effectively) \nwhen the maker becomes the maker of tools-to-make-tools ‘who \nonly incidentally produces things’. By now, judgement is made \nneither in the realm of the political nor even in relation to things \nand their usefulness, but concerns only process, or the ‘amount of \npain or pleasure experienced in the production or consumption \nof things’ (Arendt, 1998: 309). As Arendt puts it, the modern age \nthus operates under the assumption that ‘life and not the world, is \nthe highest good’ (Arendt, 1998: 318); or, as Lenz argues, Arendt’s \ncritique of the labour society is ‘based on a criticism of the absolute \ndomination of labour at the expense of other form of activities’ (Lenz,  \n2005: 145).\nBeyond the last stage? The deadliest passivity\nThe ways in which this transformation occurs, and the glancing \ninvocation of Bentham, might suggest how the history here, of the \ntransformation of work into labour and of the excision of action \nso that – to repeat – life not world is the highest good, connects to \nthe framing trope of the telescope, and in particular to its operation \nas something that may reposition humans. Arendt heads the final \nchapter of The Human Condition with an epigraph from Kafka: \n‘he found the Archimedean point, but he used it against himself; it \nseems he was permitted to find it only under this condition’ (cited \nin Arendt, 1998: 248). The point is clear. This new telescopic perspec-\ntive, at once universal rather than worldly, and individualized, or \noperating with principles of personalization, rather than dealing \nwith men and women, is at once newly intimate, swallowed and \nheld within, and radically external. It is tempting to read this as a \npeculiarly far-sighted Arendtian comment on contemporary big data \nand personalization processes today, but the germane point here is \nthat this condition is technologically given or made.\nArendt also provides a brief commentary, a matter of a couple \nof pages (Arendt, 1998: 322–323), on what might lie beyond the \nshift into generalized labour. Essentially, widespread automation is \nhere under discussion, although there is none of the matter-of-fact \ncertainty that full automation/cybernation will come that is so startling \nin the conference paper. Assessing the contemporary moment, Arendt \n No special pleading  127\nsays one element of the active life, labour, has become ‘victorious’ \nbut is itself in its final stages. Labour has become too ‘lofty’ a term \nto describe the circuitry of consumption/job holding characterizing \nthe contemporary world: ‘we have proved ingenious enough to find \nways to ease the toil and trouble of living to the point where an \nelimination of laboring from the range of human activities can no \nlonger be regarded as utopian’. Her fear is that soon all that will \nbe left is consumption. But she adds that already ‘the society of job \nholders’ demands of its members ‘a sheer automatic functioning, as \nthough individual life had actually been submerged in the overall \nlife process of the species and the only active decision still required \nof the individual were to let go … acquiesce in a dazed, “tranquilized” \nfunctional type of behavior’ (Arendt, 1998: 322).20\nFunctional behaviour here is a response that is, in Arendt’s terms, \nhighly unpolitical, not only because unreflexive but also because \nno longer individual but only individuated. She thus argues that \n‘the trouble with modern theories of behaviorism is not that they \nare wrong but that they could become true …’ (1998: 322). This \nclarifies the discussion of conditioning and adaptation in the ‘On The \nHuman Condition’ paper, where individual adaptation to changing \n(technological/techno-social) environments in which humans find \nthemselves is replaced by the automatic modulation of humans, from \nthe outside. There, we will recall, Arendt argued that it was ‘quite \nconceivable that the modern age … may end in the deadliest, most \nsterile passivity history has ever known’ (1998: 322).\nThe perceived threats here overlap. On the one hand, the fear is of \nthe rise of a society of labourers with nothing to labour on. On the \nother, there is the automated functioning of the human on automatic \npilot. Finally, there are those technologies of vision and perspective \nthrough which this, the human body, the body now unpolitic, might \nbe viewed, and manipulated. Arendt’s final – and startling – warning \nin The Human Condition  is thus that some possibility for action \nremains, but is often the prerogative of the scientist.\nThe rest of us, or the world in general, have a new perspective \nbut can only watch ourselves, as if we were processes, so that the \nmodern motorization, for instance, ‘would appear like a process of \nbiological mutation in which human bodies gradually begin to be \ncovered by shells of steel’. Moreover, from the perspective of ‘the \nwatcher from the universe’ – and this would now be the perspective \n128 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nof unearthed man – ‘this mutation would be no more or less mysteri-\nous than the mutation that now goes on before our eyes in those \nsmall organisms … which have mysteriously developed new strains \nto resist us’ (1998: 323).\nAlice Hilton told the Cybercultural conference that ‘The cyber -\ncultural society is a cybernetic system. A cybercultural society is as \ngreat as the universe’ (1966: 340). What we understand at the end \nof The Human Condition and at the end also of the Cybercultural \ndiscussions21 is that Arendt is hostile to the universal viewpoint, at \nleast in so far as it obliterates men, humans, replacing them with \nMan, who is himself at once singular, and also singularly ill-defined, \nno longer worldly but part of the pattern of the Earth as seen from \nthe inhuman view of Space.\nThere is suddenly here something from Heidegger in Arendt, as \nshe too points to how man is caught and remade in the technologies \nthat seem to give him mastery. The Archimedean point, the point \nfrom which it is possible to move the Earth, has been achieved, but \nits positioning, at once in Space, and, as in Kafka’s example, in the \nbody, tends to produce conditions in which humans are no longer \nable, despite their own role in the making of this technology, to act.\nArendt was conscious of forms of technological evolution and \ndevelopment. What the ‘On The Human Condition’ paper makes \nclear, elaborating and focusing on some of the arguments begun in \nthese final pages of The Human Condition, is that she is specifically \ninformed, and engaging in debate on the matter of cybernation, the \nend of work, due to the influences of computerization and cybernetics. \nWe might say that she had a take on this. And it was hostile: Arendt \nwas anti-computing.\nArendt’s explicit engagement with cybernation was brief. By 1970, \nin On Violence, she would comment that if one motivation for \nstudent protest was ‘the simple fact that technological progress is \nleading in so many instances straight into disaster’ (cited in Young-\nBruehl, 2006: 149), she also added that the real issue was not \nunemployment. Rather, ‘the seemingly irresistible proliferation of \ntechniques and machines, far from threatening certain classes with \nunemployment, menaces the existence of whole nations and conceiv-\nably of all mankind’ (Arendt, 1970). The issue remained politics \nand peace, but now the focus was not on technology’s role in labour \nand its ending.\n No special pleading  129\nAfter the event\nThere was no cybernation revolution. What was briefly taken seriously \nby government, industry, sections of the Left, and civil rights move-\nment, nascent feminist organizations, and Arendt herself, became \nafterwards a ‘scare’, as Ganz, who was there at the conference with \nthe other partisans of cyberculture, put it (Ganz, 1966).22 This wasn’t \nonly about practical barriers to real implementation but also a matter \nof desire and support; the cybernation imaginary faltered. What \nhappened? In ‘The Selling of the Productivity Crisis’ (1983) James \nE. Block asked why public discourse ‘led away from the consideration \nof a society less centred around the workplace’. He blamed ‘entrenched \ninterests, who wish market inequalities to persist, and do so by \nshifting the blame onto workers’, and the ‘deep collective failure’ \n(of the Left) to confront uncertainties (partly because of its historical \nassociation with the working poor), and said that as a result ‘discus-\nsions on automation, non-work society, and alternative forms of \ndistribution held in the late fifties have been deferred for a generation’ \n(Block, 1983: 13).\nCyberculture to precarity?\nAfter cybernation, analysis of the consequences of rising levels of \ncomputerization within society, and of shifts in computing itself \n(from brute automation to refined control, from ungainly giants to \noffice machines, from rarity to proliferation), took other turns. Daniel \nBell’s later work on the post-industrial society as a knowledge society, \nis key here. Essentially, as an intervention at odds with the cybernation \nthesis (see e.g. Bell, 1965, Michael, 1965) it won out (Bassett and \nRoberts, 2020).\nA different perspective on the post-cybernation debate is given \nby tracing out the notion of the cybercultural itself. If her conference \npaper usefully interrogates Arendt’s own thinking on leisure and \nwork, at a very particular moment in time, her contribution to the \ndebate on ‘cyberculture’ contributed to how the term was understood \ncritically, back then, on this, one of its very first outings. Cyberculture \nat the conference was bound up with questions of radical change \nin the political economy of the US, with the questions of war and \n130 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\npeace, as well as with the civil rights movement. Cybernation did \nnot occur, and the term itself was dropped. By contrast, whilst the \nterm cyberculture was also eclipsed in the aftermath of the scare, \nit did come back. But when it returned in the mid- to late 1980s in \nresponse to developments including the internet and its associated \nimaginaries, it did so in a peculiarly etiolated guise – being generally \ntaken to refer not to questions of labour, work and action, but to \nthe formation of contemporary social subjectivities: cyber-lives for \ncyber-selves, and cyber-society.\nMainstream 1990s cyberculture was perhaps still interested in \nquestions of labour and leisure, but now in the fusion of the two; \nit celebrated or excoriated a new playground. Its apogee, largely \nimaginary in that the technologies that were supporting it were \nnascent, was virtual reality, seen both as the other of cyberspace \nand as its fully realized form. In the latter it was roundly abused \nby commentators, including notably Kevin Robins, who, in terms \nArendt might have approved of, accused it of turning its back on \nthe world we live in (1996). The term largely slipped out of use in \nthe late 1990s and is now remembered as painfully ‘of its time’, as \nWilliam Gibson noted.23\nHuhtamo discerns a trail leading from cybernation to interactiv-\nity, to being ‘in’ the media, perhaps. I would lay a different trail; \nthis would move from cybernation to precarity24 as it is emerging \nin relation to new developments in automation. Arendt’s thinking \nlets us see that this condition needs to be explored not only in \nterms of political economy but also in relation to what might be \ntermed a political ontology. Critiques of her thinking, not least \nthose made by the Cybercultural conference audience she seduced \nand abandoned, would suggest doing so not only in relation to \nthe human condition but also by questioning the homogeneity, the \nboundedness, the unacknowledged situationality of position, of ‘the \nhuman’ in that term.\nNotes\n1 19–21 June, ‘The hottest days in any June’, Hilton (1966b: Foreword).\n2 A facsimile of the conference programmes can be seen at www . \nfredbernardwood.org/LifeTimes/TechSocietyIBM/ConfCyberRev64.pdf.\n No special pleading  131\n3 The long, hot summers of 1964/65 reference civil disturbances/riots. \nHarlem in 1964, Watts in Los Angeles in 1965, Detroit in 1967. The \nCivil Rights Act (1964) was signed by President Johnson following \nKennedy’s assassination.\n4 Great Society legislation conceded basic civil rights. The context was \nalso cybernetics and the rise of computerization. The year 1964 saw \nthe US launch of IBM System/360, the first minicomputer, built by \nDigital Equipment Corporation (DEC). See e.g. IBM’s history pages, \nwww-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/history/decade_1960.html .\n5 Arendt’ s speech is gathered in her papers at the Library of Congress, \nfiled under organizations 1943–1976 ‘Conference on Cybernetics, New \nYork’. There is also a brief typed correspondence from Alice Mary \nHilton asking for alterations.\n6 Signatories to the T riple Revolution included Alice Hilton, James Boggs \n(who also wrote a special issue of Monthly Review on the ‘workless \nsociety’), and multiple Nobel Prize-winner Linus Pauling. Another context \nto the Evolving Society debates was various proposals for organizing \nexchange in a society beyond full employment. These included proposals \nfor Living Certificates.\n7 E.g. Rights in the US were deemed ‘only a local manifestation of a \nworld wide movement’.\n8 ‘In the summer of 1964 over forty Freedom Schools opened in Mis -\nsissippi, part of Freedom Summer, a project of the Southern Civil \nRights Movement. The goal was to empower African Americans in \nMississippi to become active citizens and agents of social change’ \n(Welcome to the Freedom School Curriculum Website!  written \nby Kathy Emory, www.educationanddemocracy.org/index.html, \nwww.educationanddemocracy.org/FSCfiles/C_CC2a_TripleRevolution.htm). \nThe March 1964 curriculum conference included segments on ‘The Power \nStructure’ by SNCC research director Jack Minnis, and on the history of \nthe Freedom Movement. There were also Liberation magazine reprints \non the ‘Triple Revolution’. See Staughton Lynd’s The Freedom Schools, \nAn Informal History (accessed February 2019), www.solidarity-us.org/\ncurrent/node/477.\n9 Brozen was invoked at the conference for his gradualist views on \ncybernation, by Maxwell Goldberg (1966: 156).\n10 In my interview with Alice Mary Hilton, she said she had no recol -\nlection of Friedan attending, suggesting that she had been invited to \nspeak but had declined. The Proceedings, however, do record Friedan’s \nintervention, and list her as a discussant citing the ‘Feminine Mystique’ \n(Hilton, 1966b: 392).\n11 Panel discussion.\n132 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\n12 W .H. Ferry in discussion, Hilton, 1966b: 229.\n13 Hilton agreed with the policy of building, but thought it wouldn’ t provide \njobs in a cybernated era. For her the prime purpose of technology was \nthe ‘disempowerment’ of human beings, this latter potentially for the \ngood (ES: 233).\n14 W .H. Ferry (VP Fund for the Republic), a discussant, attacked Perlo’s \nreliance on jobs as crude economism and 19th-century thinking: ‘any \nplan for a civilized society must … include plans for jobs.’ He argued \nthat Perlo should bring his 19th-century thinking up to date. (Hilton, \n1966b: 229).\n15 Best known for authoring The American Revolution: Pages from a Negro \nWorker’s Notebook in 1963, James Boggs worked at Chrysler from 1940 \nuntil 1968. He was the husband of Grace Boggs, also an activist.\n16 Hilton says ‘adults too must be taught’, but focuses on evidence of \nthe ‘adaptability’ of man’. This includes human capacities to learn by \nforgetting. As she puts it, ‘man has always been able to forget the old \nand learn new ways’ (Hilton, 1966b: 135).\n17 ‘Idleness … the passive endurement of vacant time’ (Hilton, introduction  \nto Evolving Society session in Hilton, 1966b: 256). Vacant time was a \nrecurring discussion at the conference.\n18 The recompense is the hope that the freedom to act would produce \na revitalized public realm in which women act. As Dietz (2002) puts \nit, thinking about Arendt’s project more broadly, ‘Arendt is offering a \nway to not look inward, but to value all voices in the public realm … \nIn Arendt’s existential analysis [ … ] there is nothing intrinsically or \nessentially masculine about the public realm, just as there is nothing \nessentially feminine about labouring in the realm of necessity.’\n19 See Arendt in the preface to ‘Reflections on Little Rock’ (2003): ‘As a \nJew I take my sympathy for the cause of the Negroes as for all oppressed \nor under-privileged people for granted and should appreciate it if the \nreader did likewise.’\n20 See Dave Eggers’ The Circle for a contemporary treatment of this kind \nof sensibility.\n21 Final panel discussion: Future society reasons for hope and causes for \nfear.\n22 Ganz was from government circles (US Department of Labor). See also  \nWidner’s sense of ‘consensus … we are in the middle of the cybercultural \nrevolution’. He was responsible for a senate committee on manpower \n(Widner, quoted in Hilton, 1966b: 329).\n23 There is a widespread presumption that the term cyberculture was \ninvented alongside the worldwide web and William Gibson’s coining \nof the term ‘cyberspace’.\n No special pleading  133\n24 This trajectory can be traced in terms of resistance movements too. \nOne thread in this might be Grace Boggs, present at the conference, \nand active in the Detroit movements for many decades.\nBibliography\nAgger, Donald G. et al. 1964.

Why Arendt Matters . New Haven: Yale \nUniversity Press.\nChapter 5\nPolemical acts of rare extremism:  \nTwo Cultures and a hat1\nThe Two Cultures debate produced a furore in the modernizing era \nof the early to mid-1960s. The scientist C.P. Snow’s diagnosis of a \ncleavage that should be healed between the sciences and the arts is \nstill widely invoked. Less well remembered is that his protagonist \nF.R. Leavis also argued for the benefits of one culture. Not the one \narising out of a capitulation to technologically administered utilitarian-\nism, but the culture he discerned within a tradition of community, \nlargely lost in everyday life, but held in the English language and in \nits literature. Leavis argued that the value of the past in constructing \na politics engaging with the constitution of the present should be \nrecognized. It might also inform and found a form of hope for the \nfuture.\nThis chapter engages with Leavis’ arguments. The mode of radical \nliberalism Leavis espoused in the journal Scrutiny in the early to \nmid-20th century produced a response to technology far from \ntechnological optimism, but also distanced from Marxist critiques \nof technocratic rationality. This radicalism is often viewed as hope-\nlessly tarnished by the chauvinistic nationalism that framed and \nconstrained it, which became increasingly marked in later years. \nHowever, Francis Mulhern, amongst others, has convincingly argued \nfor a more nuanced reading of Leavis and the ‘moment of scrutiny’ \n(Mulhern, 1979), and this prompts a re-reading of Leavis’ thinking \naround the specifically technological and a reappraisal of the position \nhe took at the time of the Two Cultures debate. This is worth doing \npartly because the combinatory force of an attachment to nation, \na distrust of technocratic forms of knowledge and its claims to \nuniversality, and a moment of technological expansion has been felt \nin disturbing ways in recent decades. Brexit’s anti-expertise discourse \n Polemical acts of rare extremism  141\nand its appeal to English nationalism, populist movements in the \nUS around Trump, disquiet around algorithmically produced filter \nbubbles on social media all indicate this. My attempt, to replay the \nTwo Cultures debate from the largely eclipsed Leavis side, is under-\ntaken both to restitute an earlier structure of feeling and to explore \nthe topoi that organized it – not least because these are once again \nattended to closely in our time. What kind of replaying is this? This \nchapter begins to circulate around the issues at hand via a long-playing \nrecord: one that records a performance, that comments on a debate, \nand that reveals a landscape and a field of cultural contestation \nonce submerged – but now re-arising.\n* * *\nThings have come to a pretty underpass in England … (Flanders and \nSwann, At the Drop of Another Hat , 1963)\nHere, then, we have the cultural consequences of the technological \nrevolution. (Leavis, 2013: 86)\nLet me play you a record. ‘Heat cannot of itself pass from one \nbody to a hotter body … Heat won’t pass from a cooler to a \nhotter … You can try it if you like but you’d far better notter …’ \nPerhaps apocryphally, the largest single audience ever subjected to \nthis disquisition on thermodynamics was the American public on \nprime-time television, Christmas Day 1967, ‘on the occasion of the \nperformance by Flanders and Swann of their catchy ditty on the \nsecond law’ (Hubbard et al., 1968). The song was from At The \nDrop of Another Hat  (1963), a revue show at a London theatre, \nlater an LP. Flanders and Swann were a ‘middlebrow, 2 middle of \nthe century, musical comedy act’, one of a line of male double acts \ncontributing to a tradition that Andy Medhurst describes as part \nof the ‘national joke’ (Medhurst, 2007: 123). Secure, English, with \na show that was consciously intimate,3 it was said of Flanders and \nSwann that they passed as ‘charming amateurs who recreate your \nliving room jocularity without pretending to be professional’, whilst \nbeing in reality ‘urbane and zestful artists … professional down to \ntheir fingertips’ (Simon, 1967, 105–109). The same theatre reviewer \nnoted claims that the ‘pseudo-amateurism’ of the Flanders and Swann \nact was what gave it its characteristic ‘British-ness’.\n142 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nThe ‘Thermodynamics’ song was a pointed take on a dispute \nover the ‘Two Cultures’ of art and science that incited England’s \nintellectuals to ‘polemical acts of rare extremism’ (Mulhern, 1979: \n305) fierce enough to produce much national press coverage and \npopular discussion. Two more Englishmen, C.P. Snow and F.R. Leavis, \none a trained scientist, civil servant, and successful novelist, the \nother a literary scholar, fellow of Downing College, Cambridge, \nand founder of the journal Scrutiny, are yoked together as antagonists \nwhen this debate is raised. They are invoked as the personification \nof cleavage: between the sciences and the humanities, science and \nart, scientific and literary cultures, and technocratic values versus \ntradition as desirable logics informing a social order.\nThe Two Cultures controversy is conventionally understood as \nthe successor to an earlier clash disputing the relative priority of \nthe arts and science; the Huxley and Arnold debate of the 1870s, \nsparked by Huxley’s address at Josiah Mason College in Birmingham \n(Huxley, 1881: 15,4 Hultberg, 1997: 196, Stinner, 1989). Huxley \nargued for the priority of the study of nature over culture, and of \nscience over Arnoldian values (truth and beauty). Nature should \nlead men, and culture itself, too long locked up by the ‘Levites in \ncharge of the ark of culture and monopolists of liberal education’, \nshould be transformed to reflect better the new priorities given by \n‘the definite order’ of nature (Huxley, 1881: 3, cited in Hultberg, \n1997: 196).\nKnocking the Two Cultures debate out of its place in this line of \nsuccession can be productive. It enables a different kind of auditing \nof the arguments. Doing this is already to take sides, since Snow \ncultivated the connection between the earlier interventions and the \nTwo Cultures, whilst Leavis refused it on the disingenuous grounds \n(given his own splenetic tone) that the earlier debate had been better \ntempered and conducted between equals. For Guy Ortolano, the \nobvious disparity between the stakes of an argument around science \nand the arts in Victorian Birmingham and those of a quarrel in \n1960s London and Oxbridge means that this genealogy can be \nrejected out of hand (Ortolano, 2009, Ortolano in White, 2011: \n761–763). Ortolano rather aligns the Two Cultures debate with a \nseries of struggles between ‘technocratic’ and ‘radical’ forms of \nliberalism arising in response to a specific historical constellation \n(that of post-colonial England in the mid-1960s), one that might \n Polemical acts of rare extremism  143\nhelp identify some of the ‘structures of feeling’ (Williams, 1992, \n2009) that characterized the (conflicted) sensibilities of that moment. \nThis orientation informs the discussion here. It connects with Francis \nMulhern’s magisterial account of Scrutiny’s history, already invoked, \nand with his demand that the radicalism of the early Leavis project, \nbeginning in the 1930s with Scrutiny, be recognized, even whilst \nthe degree to which it was shattered in later work as internal tensions \nbetween materialism and idealism foundational to its project is \nacknowledged (Mulhern, 1979).\nDislodging the Two Cultures debate from its resting place in a \nline of arts/science debates makes it easier to also unpick some \nassumptions about the temporal orientations of the combatants’ \narguments. Snow’s assertion was that the ‘Luddite’ Leavisites only \nlooked backwards, wishing to dwell entirely in the past. But for \nboth sides what was at stake in this argument was not the past but \nthe future, and Leavis’ position is more complex and more interesting \nonce this is recognized. The question he sought to address was how \nto hold a brief for the future whilst also admitting a preferability \nfor the past (oddly enough, this emerges as an orientating sensibility \nin steampunk, gothic, or SF/Cyber noir aesthetics today).\nOcclusion\nC.P. Snow said the ‘Two Cultures’ formulation was more than a \nmetaphor but less than a model. It has certainly had an ‘enduring \nafterlife’ (Dizikes, 2009),5 becoming an, if not obligatory, then \nacknowledged reference or passage point in discussions around the \nimpacts and values of science and technology on society, a synecdoche \nfor ‘what is at stake’ still invoked in debates around science and \nculture, technology and culture, hermeneutics and instrumentalism, \nthe stakes of literacy and technical knowledge in an era of computa-\ntion; arguments about code literacy, hacking versus yacking, program-\nming and education are all relevant here. In a sense, the term invites \nitself in. It becomes a form of ‘currency’, in Leavis’ (pejorative) \nsense of the word, offering itself for adoption in relation to emerging \nformations; one of its recent re-emergences has been in work exploring \ndigital humanities, which latter directly engages with ‘English’ and \nits computerization, amongst other things. The persistence of the \n144 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nformulation does not signal full acceptance of what it promotes. It \nhas long been critiqued for the binary division it inscribes; even \nSnow himself later acknowledged that there might be three or more \ncultures. Others including Adrian Mackenzie and Andrew Murphie \n(2008) have argued for multiple, overlapping ‘cultures’. But the \ncritiques are of Snow’s formulation, while the attack by Leavis, \nconstituting one half of the exchange and generating more than half \nof the controversy at the time, is rarely explored. In public com-\nmentary around the fiftieth anniversary of the Two Cultures debates \nin 2009, it was striking how little was said about Leavis, about the \ndiscourse of ‘counter-modernity’ as he articulated it, or about his \ncritique of unthinking technologization. The focus was on Snow, \nand the adequacy and relevance or otherwise of his sense of a \nscience/arts cultural cleavage. The debate is remembered in Snow’s \nterms. In this sense he won.\nObliteration?\nToday Leavis’ ideas about technology and culture appear to be \nlargely irrelevant. They have nothing to say to science, whereas, as \nnoted, Snow’s term still has some bite, even if the arguments the \nlatter introduced under its banner largely do not. In English the \nLeavisite project was dead by the late decades of the 20th century, \neclipsed by structuralism and post-structuralism in various guises, \nand by the related rise of various forms of feminist and post-colonial \nthinking inimical to the unexamined universalism of Leavisite \nhumanism. Leavis’ considerable contribution to the development of \nBritish cultural studies (see later) is now largely disavowed, as Mulhern \nand others have pointed out. This provides a starting point, since \nthe apparently wholesale deletion of a perspective might be as \ninforming as the perspective itself. It is interesting to explore why \n(and/or for whom) Leavis’ thinking is no longer thinkable at all. \nNot least because, as the conclusion to this chapter argues, what is \nno longer ‘thinkable’ in particular registers, or thinkable as a coherent \nwhole, may continue to inform a sensibility, or to emerge in fragments, \nto trouble the present. It may be that a mode of hostility towards \nthe rise of technological values that resonates with the Leavisite \nobjections to demands for a particular kind of cultural ‘healing’ is \nso thoroughly diffused into everyday discourse that it is hard to \n Polemical acts of rare extremism  145\ntease out and identify, even if it does inform contemporary hostility \nto new literary formations or approaches.\nRaymond Williams6 characterized as ‘residual’ those elements of \na social structure that relate back to older forms that originally \nsustained them, now gone, but which remain active (Williams, 2009). \nThe case I am going to make is that Leavis’ thinking on technology \nengaged with, and even contributed to the production of, the intel-\nlectual justification for a particular kind of anti-computing, but was \nalready residual, perhaps, even in its time. Today this always already \nresidual mode of anti-computing, which resonates with the Leavisite \nposition, might be extant, and might be a mode whose very amor-\nphousness, as well as its relative impotence against the various claims \nof ‘progress’ it seeks to question, renders it tricky to investigate. \nWilliams’s sense of the residual, however, even if useful, might \nunderplay, if not the tenacity of earlier forms, then their capacity \nto remap onto new formations and revive. Investigating this, at the \nend of this chapter I briefly consider where Leavis’ sense of the \nrelationship between English community and technological ‘progress’ \nmight be revenant today. And why that is disturbing.\nI have no intention of becoming a belated member of the Leavisite \n‘clerisy’. There is much in the Leavisite programme, including its \nnaturalized muscular, white, view of ‘humanity’ and its avocation \nof an increasingly strident nationalism, that repels. Nonetheless, it \nseems important to examine, rather than simply set aside as unpalat-\nable, or simply not worth re-excavating, the particular kind of hostility \nto technocratic rationality that Leavis espoused. It constituted a \nsignificant strand in a tapestry of responses to early computerization \nand automation in an England on the edge of cultural change across \na series of fronts in mid- to late 20th century. The Two Cultures \ndebate took place near enough to 1963, when, as the poet Philip \nLarkin famously put it, sexual intercourse was just beginning (Larkin, \n1974). Less often noticed, so too was business computing.\nThe Rede Lecture\nSnow’s ‘Two Cultures’ intervention came in the late 1950s, in the \nRede Lecture, which was published in The New Statesman and in \nEncounter.7 There Snow identified a rift between the sciences and \nthe arts, claimed that this posed a threat to Britain and/or British \n146 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\ninfluence in a post-colonial era, and called for this rift to be closed \nthrough measures resulting in the ‘integration of Two Cultures’ \n(Hultberg, 1997: 200), or two ‘social orders’ – those of literary \nculture and natural science (Snow 1959: 10). This demanded new \nforms of literacy and, complaining that literary cultures ‘revel … \narrogantly in their ignorance’ (Hultberg, 1997), Snow argued that \n‘basic literacy’ (Collini, 1993) should be judged not only by literary \ncriterion but also by knowledge of scientific fundamentals: Shake-\nspeare and the First and Second Laws (of thermodynamics) (Snow, \n1959: 14). If the text of the lecture is explored in any depth, it is \nobvious that Snow’s real concern was for the advancement of science \nand scientific values over other values; as Sam Leith put it, the \n‘apparent even-handedness of the way Snow articulated the divide \nis … deceptive; Snow was taking sides’ (Leith, 2009). From Snow’s \nperspective, ‘literary intellectuals’ hostile to the values of science \nand ignorant of its basic tenets had come define cultural values in \ngeneral as ‘literary’ values. Worse, this kind of valuation was opera-\ntional in the ‘corridors of power’ (Snow, 2000), which was why it \nwas of consequence. Leith again:\n[Snow] might have regretted all those physicists not having managed \nto read Dickens but he would not have thought that it actually mattered \nvery much. The scientific illiteracy of the humanities graduates, in \nSnow’s view, mattered very much indeed – and the reason that it \nmattered was that these were the people in charge of things … (Leith, \n2009).\nThe (loosely) anthropological register of much of Snow’s lecture, \nat one with the novelistic style adopted in his fictions about public \nscience, and aligning with his interest in science as practice (Hultberg, \n1997), might have contributed to acceptance of the egregious ‘even-\nhanded’ reading; Dizikes argues that Snow’s assumption of the role \nof ‘eagle-eyed anthropologist’ dissembled his sense of himself as \nthe ‘evangelist of our technological future’ (Dizikes, 2009). But \nthe message is clear enough, for Snow, science ‘must progress over \ntime’ and will progress (Snow, 1959: 204), science is the basis of \nprosperity, security, and ‘social hope’ (Snow, 1959: 27), and the \nscientific orientation is progressive and creative, and so, therefore, \nare those who embody this orientation, those who live by scientific \nvalues. For Snow, hope (and sometimes ‘goodness’) inheres in scientists \n Polemical acts of rare extremism  147\nwho ‘have the future in their bones’ (Snow, 1959: 10); as habitus, \nperhaps. Snow’s utilitarian or Benthamite argument saw scientific \napproaches as essential for the common good of the many. His \nclaim was that the social hope science provides could now be made \navailable to human society in general, and specifically to Britain \nand British people in a world after Empire – these arguments being \ndeveloped through a discussion of science education and/as British \nforeign policy. Leith (2009) reads this as a demand to spread the \nbenefits of the scientific revolution to the dispossessed so as to avoid \nthem helping themselves via social revolution. Dizikes, also assessing \nthe global intents of the lecture, describes it as ‘irretrievably’ a Cold \nWar document (2009).\nIn contrast to scientists, ‘literary intellectuals’ are labelled natural \n‘Luddites’, people ‘wishing the future did not exist’ who can therefore \nhave no relevance in the project of making it (Snow, 1959: 11). \nSnow indeed comes close to arguing that literary values can only be \nthoroughly retrograde, particularly when various modernist writers \nwhose engagements with fascism were well known at the time are \ninvoked as the, if not typical, then at least unsurprising products, of \nthe literary attitude in general – the implication being that literary \nvalues breed such ‘unfree’ approaches and attitudes. Close reading of \nSnow’s lecture confirms which group he believes should inherit the  \nfuture.\nThe lecture was noticed in interested circles (for instance, provoking \nletters in the Encounter), but did not initially attract general attention. \nIt was Leavis’ response, made two years later in the Richmond \nLecture (1962), delivered at Downing College and published by the \nSpectator,8 which launched the debate that became notorious. In \nhis lecture Leavis raged expertly, precisely, and with venom, attacking \nthe argument and the author. Snow, he said, was as ‘intellectually \nas undistinguished as it is possible to be … he doesn’t know what \nhe means and doesn’t know he doesn’t know’. Amongst Leavis’ \nmore scabrous remarks was the assertion that Snow’s novels must \nhave been written by an electronic brain – perhaps one named \nCharlie. Only this, he said, could explain the mechanistic writing \nand lack of life they exhibited (Leavis, 2013: 57). Leavis justified a \npersonal attack on the grounds that Snow had come to embody the \nideas he promulgated. He had become ‘a portent of our civilization’, \nand attacking him was necessary for forensic reasons. Leavis’ claim \n148 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nthat this necessity was regrettable wasn’t necessarily convincing. \nCollini comments that:\nA malevolent deity, setting out to design a single figure in whom the \nlargest number of Leavis’s deepest antipathies would find themselves \nembodied, could not have done better than to create Charles Percy \nSnow. (Collini, 1993: xxxii)\nThis may be the case. But there is also the proposition that what \nSnow embodied, and what Leavis attacked, was not only Snow the \nhubristic scientist and indifferent novelist, but Snow the calculating \nmachine, Snow the computer ‘brain’ that proceeded by way of \nmechanistic processing rather than human reasoning. Leavis scathingly \nattacked Snow’s confidence in himself as a ‘master-mind’, as Collini \nnotes (1993: 9), and it is interesting to consider the degree to which \nthe ‘master-mind’ in question was devoid of all human qualities. \nWas it Snow himself, or electronic Charlie, the probability machine, \nthat was the portent?\nBathos\nIn response to the Richmond Lecture some condemned Leavis’ tone \nbut were sympathetic to his argument. The Guardian regretted a \n‘vehement and directly personal’ attack on a ‘famous social critic’ \nlinked with ‘the doctrine of the Two Cultures’ (The Guardian, 1962). \nThe literary critic Lionel Trilling condemned the ‘impermissible tone’ \nof the lecture, a remark that circulated widely (Collini, 1993: xxxvii, \nMatthews, 2004: 60). The violence of Leavis’ attack amplified the \ndebate and the resulting ‘substantial furore’ involved ‘most of the \nprint media’ (Matthews, 2004: 51) of the day.\nThe debate had absurd elements. Leavis’ raging was notorious, \nbut there was also Snow’s pomposity, a bathetic unevenness in register \nevident in his lecture, badly chosen examples of cultural snobbery \nand scientific ignorance, and the implication – easy to maliciously \ninfer by Snow’s enemies – that he truly believed scientific language \nshould become an everyday language in the drawing rooms of \nEngland, or at least in the common rooms of ancient universities. \nSnow’s discussion of literacy is partly framed in relation to his own \nexperiences of being ‘brushed off’ at the hands of literary intellectuals, \nand his call for recognition of the scientific as that which is beyond \n Polemical acts of rare extremism  149\nsuch niceties as cultural capital and beyond individual desires or \nconceits resolves into a querulous and incongruous demand for due \nrespect; ‘hear the status symbols/cymbals clash’, as Flanders and \nSwann put it in another song in the same Hat show as their ‘Ther-\nmodynamics’ song.\nThe ‘social hope’ science offered, identified by Snow as a (post-\ncolonial) global necessity for British foreign policy, also had to \ndo, it turned out, with prestige, power, control, and influence in \nthe English universities. The choice of example and its tone9 came \nback to haunt Snow (1959: 14–15) and his supporters (e.g. The \nGuardian, 1962).\nHat performers Flanders and Swann exploited the bathos of the \nwhole affair in their genial but lethal takedown of Snow, which \nbegins with a solicitude as artificial as the domestic setting of the \noriginal stage set. The problem that has been raised, say Flanders \nand Swann, is how to talk to the scientist, who speaks another \nlanguage – so you must address him in his own tongue: ‘ah h2so4 \nprofessor … the reciprocal of Pi to your good wife … don’t synthesize \nanything I wouldn’t synthesize … this he will understand’. The \nscientist is to be talked to with the kind of elaborate politeness \nthat replaces casual discourse amongst (true) equals – ‘you can’t \nask him to lend you a quid’. Framing ordinary social intercourse in \n‘scientific’ terms will enable the scientist to take part in the general \nconversation – or, rather, in what passes for general conversation \namongst academic men. The ‘Thermodynamics’ song, following this \nbanter, completes the attack; ‘Heat cannot of itself pass from one \nbody to a hotter body’ … The song is a virtuoso rendition of the \nFirst and Second laws and is correct in essentials. It is thus airily \nimplied that scientific literacy is easily accomplished – a matter of \nthe right doggerel. Its conclusion goes further, hinting that science \nmight lead down roads that are not worth travelling anyway. It ends \nwith an appeal to the seductive claims of entropy (always appealing \nto Flanders and Swann, who famously sang of ‘mud, glorious mud’) \nover the rigours of constant progress, or constant work; ‘heat is \nwork/and work’s a curse/and if all the heat in the universe …’. The \nproject of ‘talking to scientists’ as well as ‘talking science’ is thus \nboth accomplished and its absurdity proclaimed. Scientific literacy is \ndelivered and Snow’s framing of science/scientists as the bearer(s) of \n‘social hope’, which also came with a demand to be taken seriously \npersonally, is lampooned through a ruthless depiction of the social \n150 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nhopelessness of the scientist. This intervention into the Two Cultures \ndebate, mocking the claims of scientific culture (and the pomposity \nof academic culture in general), still surfaces in discussions of the \nart/science divide over the years. More often, however, the song is \ninvoked in accounts of the laws themselves – notably in educational \nmaterial – but the critique around it is forgotten.\nWhich England?\nThe Flanders and Swann Two Cultures skit might appear to have \nlittle to say about Leavis specifically, since it is Snow’s proposition \nand his desire for parity in the drawing room that is lampooned. \nBut, playing the record again, a particular kind of context can be \ndiscerned arising through a series of numbers skewering early to \nmid-1960s liberal England and its discontents. These deal in anxieties \nabout technocratic futures, modernity, displacement, the replacement \nof ‘organic community’ with new forms of ‘civilization’ or modern \nlife (Leavis’ terms, as discussed below). They include a lament for \nthe land (‘Bedstead Men’), a satire on conspicuous consumption \n(‘Design for Living’), on sexual scandal (the Profumo affair), and \na pastiche of the public utilities’ bureaucratic grip on modern domestic \nlife (‘The Gasman Cometh’). What can be audited is a certain hostility \nto science and technology, one that connects with other values in \nplay, including those around (the fall of) Empire and nation (‘The \nEnglish Are Best’). A satirical paean to the ‘triumph’ of British \nengineering of the aeroplane ends when ‘the ashtray falls off’ – taken \nas evidence that ‘if God had intended us to fly he’d never have given \nus the railways’. Flanders and Swann also sing of these, but more \nobviously seriously. Their ‘Slow Train’ song (1963) celebrates names \nand places carved into the English landscape, and into the collective \nmemory, by the railway, and mourns the planned closure of many \nlines under the Beeching axe:\nMillers Dale for Tideswell, Kirby Muxloe … No more will I go … \nWe won’t be meeting again, on the Slow Train ….\nIn ‘Slow Train’ an industrial-era technology, having become a settled \npart of the English landscape, is remarked upon as it passes away.10 \n‘The Bedstead Men’, meanwhile, comments on the widespread \n Polemical acts of rare extremism 151\ndespoliation of the rural countryside. It works through a satirical \ncommentary on the evolution of a traditional form of association; \nthe Bedstead Men litter and dump where their forebears smuggled \nor robbed highways. They are portrayed, through the words and \nthe forms of the folk song, as absurdly mythic figures, men of the \nEnglish landscape.\nWhat begins to emerge is a sense that everyday life – its cultures, \nits mores, its cultural memory, and its hope for the future – is \nsomewhat precarious. As Flanders and Swann put it, ‘things have \ncome to a pretty underpass in England’. The worldview they offer \nis of a land experiencing rapid and pervasive transformation. An \nold way of life is being swallowed up and is sometimes mourned \nfor. The liberalism of Flanders and Swann, given a radical edge by \ntheir satirical intervention into political affairs of the day, also has \na deeply conservative side. A thick, rich, vein of nostalgia, a com -\nmentary on ‘progress’ and what it leaves behind – old worlds and \nold social mores, ended but not quite replaced – runs through the \nHat shows. This vein is entangled with the critique of the absurdities \nof modern life, and of science-speak and its prophets, that more \ndirectly comments on the stakes of the Snow/Leavis dispute. Flanders \nand Swann articulate a worldview not entirely at ease with unex -\namined progress as it is heralded and delivered through techno-\nscientific advance; least of all when this impacts on traditional forms \nof everyday life (which they also skewer). Even whilst they deal \nwith the new, and take it on cheerfully enough, their shows offer a \nmore or less liberal commentary on consumerization, technologization, \nand technocratic rationality in a post-Empire Britain that is also \nconservative; somewhat resigned – even fatalistic – in tone, and, \ndespite the horseplay, rather serious.\nA stage act certainly does not constitute systematic political critique, \nbut this one did make an appeal to a set of (undefined, presumed, \nassumed) shared sensibilities; those of an imagined community \nperhaps, one which both performers and audience are presumed \nto be a part of, even whilst the latter are also systematically mocked. \nWhat is articulated is strikingly, and consistently, at odds with Snow’s \nsense that ‘social hope’ rests with scientific advance, that the latter is \nthe basis for social hope, and is the necessary orientation for ‘society’.\nThe anti ‘technologico-Benthamite’ cultural politics of Leavis, \nexhibited in the Two Cultures writings and developed over decades, \n152 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nclearly do not align with those of Flanders and Swann (whose \nmetropolitan act would be at odds with Scrutiny’s early provincial \nausterity, apart from anything else). But the themes that emerge in \nFlanders and Swann’s revue act resonate with themes that inform \nLeavis’ body of work, the latter also striking for its advocacy of \n‘continuity’, ‘tradition’, and ‘community’ and for its attack on \nutilitarianism. That’s why, in stepping out of the line and going \naround by way of the Hat, it is possible gain a new sense of the \narguments informing the Two Cultures debates, and the stakes \nat the time. Alignments and articulations that have since become \nnaturalized shift and become possible to adjust or disturb. With this \nsense of realignment in mind I now turn back to explore Leavis’ \nearlier thinking on the technological and to ask how it informs the \nTwo Cultures debate.\nLeavis and his sword: the modern crisis\nLeavis co-founded Scrutiny, the project with which he is most \nassociated, in 1932. Scrutiny concerned itself with English literature, \nfinding in English a resource for intervening in culture, understood \nas literature and as a material form, as language and as life. In \nEducation and the University Leavis argued that these terms could \nnot be divided, that there was nothing merely ‘literary’ about the \nliterary mind (Milner, 2002: 34). The “‘governing theme” of Scrutiny \nwas industrialization and its destructive effects on society and culture’ \n(Mulhern, 1979: 50, citing Leavis and Thompson, 1933). Decades \nbefore the Two Cultures events Scrutiny was waging war on \ntechnologico-Benthamite tendencies and logics. Industrialization and \nthe automated culture, automated society, and the automated forms \nof life it produced were regarded as the forces producing a ‘crisis \nof modernity’,11 sometimes adumbrated as the ‘modern crisis’. In \nthe Restatement for Critics Leavis put this in stark terms:\nis the machine power to triumph or to be triumphed over, to be the \ndictator or the servant of human ends? (Leavis, 1933: 320 and Leavis, \ncited in Mulhern, 1979: 60)\nScrutiny writers thought differently about ‘machine power’; Leavis \nfocused on how human interventions gave particular characteristics \nto emerging machines, whilst Denys Thompson’s sense was of the \n Polemical acts of rare extremism  153\nfundamental ‘spiritual malfeasance’ of technology (entailing a version \nof Innes’ bias of technology), for instance. But, albeit by various \nroutes, Scrutiny reached a shared position which was, baldly stated, \nthat as a result of industrialization and modernization, itself the \nproduct of technology and the structures it produced or enabled, a \nsociety of widespread standardization had emerged. This society \nwas characterized by the prioritization of the mass (the ‘herd’) and \nof mass decisions, the hollowing-out of bodies and individuals, and \nthe evisceration of language, which was felt to be increasingly losing \nits capacity to signify (Mulhern, 1979: 55). In sum, there was what \nLeavis termed an inadequacy of experience, and what Knight, another \nScrutiny adherent, defined as a sense of a crisis of ‘life’ itself (Knight, \ncited in Mulhern, 1979: 75).\nAgainst all this, which is to say against the depredations of \nindustrial commercial ‘civilization’ and the ascendant values of \ntechnological/technocratic rationality, Scrutiny asserted the values \nof continuity, tradition, and above all community, for it was ‘organic \ncommunity’ that was under threat. Community was set against \n‘civilization’ and viewed as counterpart to agendas based on the \ncriterion of ‘progress’, particularly technological progress, both as \nmeans and as end. This latter Leavis often termed Wellsian thinking. \nCommunity was ‘affirmed in tradition’ and inhered in social life, \nthough not in social structures. Everyday life was valued because it \nheld a ‘residium’ of this essential tradition (Knight, cited in Mulhern, \n1979: 75), but even this was felt to have become a despoiled source. \nA ‘last sanctuary’ could be found, however, in ‘the tradition of \nEnglish literature’, which could become a repository of the values \nScrutiny held dear and might make possible the continuity of a \nform of community. For this reason literary values were held not \nto be separate from questions of community but, on the contrary, \nexpressed, and should be judged by, standards of life. They are, in \na sense, its performance and its archive. Culture (taking literary \nform in English literature) was thus understood as the cumulative \nmeaning of tradition (Mulhern, 1979: 75). Consonant with that, \nthough later, at the time of the Two Cultures debate, Leavis would  \ncomment:\nI don’t believe in any ‘literary values’, and you won’t find me talking \nabout them; the judgments the literary critic is concerned with are \njudgments about life … (Leavis, 2013: 110)\n154 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nA consequence of this conjunction is that attending to literature \nmay enable a particular kind of space to open up, one that is public \nor at least common. Mulhern aptly sums up Scrutiny as embodying \na cluster of ideas around the ‘nature of literature and its place in \nsocial life’ (Mulhern, 1979: 328) and as aiming to restore the values \nof community ‘to some kind of authority in the modern world’ \n(Mulhern,1979: 76.). The point is that the Leavisite position did not, \nin intent at least, signal a withdrawal. The English archive was not \nto become a sequestered, dead thing. Scrutiny was a public project \nand Leavis and his co-thinkers were interventionists. They sought \nnot only to name the modern crisis but to fight for a new form of \ncounter-modernity (see also Mulhern, 1979). Scrutiny believed it \nwas right ‘to hold to a belief in the preferability of the past, whilst \nresolving to act in and for the present’. There was to be ‘no mere \ngoing back’, and the engagement with tradition, and specifically the \ntradition of community, implied more than a simple form of nostalgia \n(Leavis and Thompson, 1933: 96). In the first issue of Scrutiny \nD.W. Harding argued that it was possible to combine nostalgia with \nrealism, and to distinguish it from regression (see Henstra, 2009: \n55). Nostalgia could be radicalized. The memory of the old was to \nbe an ‘incitement’ towards the new world (Leavis and Thompson, \n1933: 97), and there was to be nothing here of an attachment to \nfolk wisdom, always rather despised by Leavis.\nScrutiny ended in 1953. Leavis declared its influence ‘decisive’ but \nprivately thought it had failed. It had not been embedded in Cambridge \nEnglish and would, he felt, peter out with his retirement (Mulhern, \n1979: 302). However, in his formal response to C.P. Snow, in the Rich-\nmond Lecture of 1962 he argued that Scrutiny’s attempt to maintain \na ‘critical function’ was relevant to the Two Cultures moment (Leavis,  \n2013: 76).12\nSnow’s lecture began with art and science, but Leavis began with \ntechnology. Holding Snow and his work up for investigation he \nannounced: ‘Here, then, we have the cultural consequences of the \ntechnological revolution’ (Leavis, 2013: 86). For Leavis these conse-\nquences were often explored as forms of ‘technologico-Benthamism’. \nThe term might be surprising, given the tight association, in the \nhumanities at least, of Benthamism with Foucault’s more or less \npost-human discussion of governmentality and his account of the \nPanopticon in Discipline and Punish (1975; see also During, 1992: \n Polemical acts of rare extremism  155\n5). Leavis’ definition of the term – though not his use of it – is not \nso very far from Foucault’s. For him, technologico-Benthamism was \na mode of organizing society that discarded human ‘significances, \nvalues and non-measurable ends’ (Leavis, 1972: 110). It designated \nthose entangled processes of technologically driven systematization, \nbureaucratization, and individuation that are found at the heart \nof many resurgent anti-computing anxieties today (when they are \noften explored in Foucauldian or post-Foucauldian terms). The \ndifference comes in the unqualified defence of humanism that this \nproduces. Amigoni aptly sums up Leavis’ attack on Benthamism \nand the acceleration of the implementation of Benthamite forms \nof utilitarianism through technology as an attack on ‘inhumane’ \nutilitarianism from the perspective of humanism (Amigoni, 2011: \n23). Further, if the earlier Leavisite texts indicate that this general \norientation was long standing, the Richmond Lecture indicates that \nit was constantly being revived in relation to new technologies – and \nparticularly new communicational and computational technologies \nemerging in the 1960s.13\nInhumanity – set against full humanity – was key in Leavis’ \nresponse to the contention that literary intellectuals were backwards \nlooking. First, he made a distinction between marking a loss and \nacknowledging its consequences and simply repining. Community \nof a particular kind, based on craft, or rural life, for instance was \nnot ‘something we should aim at recovering; but … something finally \ngone’ (Leavis, 2013: 107), on the other hand, marking this loss did \nmatter – and industrialization, Leavis argued, had entailed heavy \nlosses. He attacked the contention that it had involved a simple \ndecision, a freely made and painless choice, by a previously agri-\ncultural society, to leave the land, as Snow had implied. This \ndescription, he felt, failed to acknowledge the full complexity of the \nprocess, as a historical process, and above all failed to frame it as \na ‘full human’ 14 problem (Leavis, 2013: 70). It also produced a \nviewpoint within which no proper understanding of the contemporary \nposition could be had or would be countenanced:\nif you insist on the need for any other kind of concern, entailing \nforethought, action and provision, about the human future  – any \nother kind of misgiving – than that which talks in terms of productivity, \nmaterial standards of living, hygienic and technological progress, then \nyou are a Luddite. (Leavis, 2013: 64)\n156 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nPasts and futures\nLeavis’ argument turned not only on what was gone but needed to \nbe marked, but also on what remained live. These were the stakes \nin setting (his) ‘cultural tradition’ against (Snow’s) adumbration \nof ‘traditional culture’. Cultural tradition was live, demanding not \nreposeful mourning, but wakefulness. It could traverse the community, \nand had done so until, threatened by industrialization in general, and \ntechnologico-Benthamism or technologically driven and delivered \nmodes of new utilitarianism in particular, it was pushed back to a \nlast stronghold in English literature. But even in those conditions, \nargued Leavis, continuity – the old watchword of Scrutiny – pertained. \nFor Leavis there is a continuity between the material culture of an \norganic community and its literary articulation . So, whilst Snow \nidentified the presence in contemporary society of two cultures, \nopenly demanded their integration, and covertly lobbied for the \ntriumph of the scientific orientation, as the dominant form, over \nthat of the literary, the burden of Leavis’ argument was (also but \nvery differently) that there could only be one culture (Leavis, 2013).\nFor Leavis, continuity is grounds for hope and is the means through \nwhich he will come to the ‘explicit positive note that has all along \nbeen my goal (for I am not a Luddite)’. The cultural tradition he \nvalorizes allows for questions of the future to be raised because it \nis a continuous living tradition, based in a present reality, and lived \nby humans ‘on the spot’, in that place where they find themselves \n(Leavis, 2013: 67), that place in which they may recognize themselves \nperhaps, because they are, or to the extent that they are, embedded \nin tradition. To be on the spot is thus to be in tradition and to be in \nthe present. Leavis contrasts this with Snow’s offer for a society built \non the promise of ‘jam tomorrow’ which ‘enjoins us to do our living \nin the dimension of “social hope”’ (Leavis, 2013: 69). For Leavis, \n‘jam tomorrow’, or the promised benefits of technologically driven \nexpansion and plenty, was what came of relying not on cultural \ntradition but on the promises of growth driven by technology. He \nclaimed that his objection was not to this kind of program per se, \nbut to the one-sided reliance on the forms of knowledge it would \nprovide and principles it would work through:\nTo point out these things is not to be a Luddite. It is to insist on the \ntruth that, in an age of revolutionary and constantly advancing \n Polemical acts of rare extremism  157\ntechnology, the sustained collaborative devotion of directed energy \nand directing intelligence that is science needs to be accompanied  \nby another, and quite different, devotion of purpose and energy,  \nanother sustained collaborative effort of creative intelligence. (Leavis, \n2013: 108)\nLeavis’ response to Snow, his argument that tradition and culture be \nprotected from the assault of the technocrats and their ‘Benthamite’ \nevisceration and standardization, was thus both an analysis and a \ndemand. True to his earlier principles, Leavis set continuity and \ntradition against the specializing, divisive, eviscerating, amnesiac \nqualities of a world reorganized according to the principles of a \nnew form of technocratic rationality, which he understood Snow \nto embody. This was his rejoinder to Snow’s demand for specialist \ncultures.\nLeavis’ attack on social hope was integral to his rebuttal of Snow’s \n(quasi-anthropologically based) argument that scientists themselves \nform a culture because they, unlike non-scientists, ‘think alike’, or \nare alike. In his lecture Snow called scientists ‘creative rather than \ncritical’, adding that as a consequence of this they tended to be \n‘good-natured and brash’ (Hultberg, 1997, 202 citing Snow). His \ncheerful scientists, whistling their way to the neutron bomb, or in his \nnovels seeing no way out of this trajectory except betrayal (see the \nStrangers and Brothers series, and in particular Corridors of Power, \n2000 [1964]) stand against the mordant English traditionalists, and \nthe two camps already look very different. However, ‘thinking alike’ \nin Snow’s hands also entails a form of individual renunciation. The \npoint for Snow is that ‘social hope’ will be delivered by the specialist \ngeneral community of science for whom personal wishes and desires \nare irrelevant and selfish (they are perhaps ‘good-natured’ by training). \nThe principles that make for best practice for scientists are based \non impartial calculation of best-case scenarios for populations in \ngeneral, generating work and setting priorities in favour of the ‘greater \ngood’, defined as that which brings progress to humanity. Literary \nintellectuals meanwhile are set down as antisocial, culpably selfish for \ntaking their own desires into account in bemoaning industrialization \nand its acceleration, and as living in the wrong tense.\nBy contrast, for Leavis the individual is the locus of decision, of \ncompass, and of judgement. He can thus ask: What is the ‘social \ncondition’ that has nothing to do with the ‘individual condition’? \nWhat is the ‘social hope’ that transcends, cancels or makes indifferent \n158 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nthe inescapable tragic condition of each individual (Leavis, 2013: \n65)? There is culture and its traditions, bound into community, and \nthe individual who constitutes it. Without individuals, and this is \nat the heart of the bodily attack on Snow and the attack on the \nbody of his work, there can be no human values but only a civilization \nbased on technocratic values, and quantifiable ends, which deals \nwith units of population. For Leavis, the computer–writer, the C.P. \nSnow automaton, is the personification, or perhaps better the \ninstantiation, of this technologico-Benthamite orientation (and in, \nthis sense, is already not human at all), and threatens the very \nexistence of the last repository of culture and continuity – since \nhow can ‘English’ be defended without human readers? Leavis’ \nanti-computing quip, his comment that the writer of the Rede Lecture \nwas quite possibly a computer, is thus deadly in intent. The computer–\nwriter Charles Snow replaces the human with the computer and \nobliterates sense and judgement, founded in the human individuals \nand confirmed through that durable engagement between them that \nfinds value or significance, and might constitute a community. In \nthe place of this is put a moment of calculation. Significance is \nreplaced by statistical ‘solutions’. As Leavis had put it long before, \nin Nor Shall My Sword, the result of such thinking would be that \n‘we need take no ends into account in our planning and calculating \nbut those which are looked after by quantitative criteria, the statistical: \n“quality”, that is will take care of itself’ (Leavis, 1972: 138).\nIf the protagonists in the Two Cultures dispute were contending \nfor ‘humanity’ and who ‘has’ it, then a peculiar irony here is that \nattack on the ‘computer’ Charles who/which threatens to usurp ‘life’ \nis made in the context of the Leavisite substitution of English literature \n– and the guardian of its canons – for those forms of ‘life’ that \npreviously constituted ‘organic’ community, that were held in other \nforms of culture. The material that stands against the computer and \nits code is the text and its language; English literature, which for \nLeavis has become the repository of what would once have been \npart of a general sensibility (one that was not, to use the term \n‘dissociated’, as T.S. Eliot had put it in the early 1920s). Arguably, \nthere are no ‘full human’ bodies left on either side of this dispute.\nLeavis’ general defence, as it was constructed, found resonance \nwith many. Whether or not his insistence that his version of cultural \ntradition was not simply nostalgic was convincing, it appeared to \n Polemical acts of rare extremism  159\nconnect with a structure of feeling in England at that time – something \nlike that found in some of the Flanders and Swann songs invoked \nearlier; those combining a sense of change and loss, of something \nmoving away at a fast pace, with a sense of the rise of new absurdities \nemerging as a consequence of technological modernity. Leavis’ sense \nwas that control was in danger of being lost, ceded to machines \nand machine makers. This was now a matter not (only) of abandoning \nculture to look for laws in nature (these were Huxley’s terms, it will \nbe recalled) but also of inventing the mechanisms to recapitulate \nthese laws on social grounds (Snow on science and the social good), \nand he argued that it gave away something important: human \nautonomy and maturity. This too found support; The Spectator \nmounted a cautious defence of Leavis, or at least a rebuttal of \nunthought-through technological progress, in terms that refer to \nthis sense of infantilization:\nIf we think of some purpose then we shall be able to make the future \ninstead of being carried along by it like children in the arms of \nautomation. (The Spectator, 1962)\nNon-inevitable consequences\nOthers, by the time of the Two Cultures debate, already had ‘purposes’ \nand visions of possible futures that were not necessarily those of \nThe Spectator, or Snow, or Leavis. With childhood and adulthood \ninvoked, we could say these others sought to grow up differently. \nTo conclude, then, let me briefly here return a final time to the \nHat performances, which took place more or less in that space \nLarkin adumbrated – somewhere after the Chatterley trial and \nbefore the ascent of the Beatles,15 a space that held possibilities that \nwere, as Larkin noted, somewhat inaccessible to those native to an  \nolder time.\nIn the final verses of the ‘Thermodynamics’ song, heat and work \n(energy and its transformations) are translated back to ‘culture’; \n‘heat is work’ (says physics) and ‘work’s a curse’ (said emerging \nsocial movements of the time) – and ‘all the heat in the universe’ \nhad ‘better cool down’ (say Flanders and Swann). Here is a sudden \nglimpse of a different future; an era of ‘cool’. This is only a glimpse \nand it is laid aside.16 In the end, the finale (offered by science, \n160 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nprovided in song) is entropy, a universal brownness17 covers all – in \nglorious mud. Flanders and Swann thus publicly give up on both \nkinds of cool and go back to the drawing room, their furbelowed \nretreat. They never intended to be hip and fashionable, nor to espouse \nshiny new science. Their act says that they know their place, but it \nalso signals that they know their time. They were (and I suppose \nalways are, as often as the LP is spun up again), on the cusp of \nbeing superseded by a rising youth culture and its counter-cultural \ninfluences. Neither they, nor their performances, were avant-garde, \nas they acknowledged off-stage in various places.\nAll the old men and England too\nLeavis and Snow, that other pair, were also of a generation that \nwas, at the time of the Two Cultures debate (and the Hat shows) \nbeing moved (in) on. The form of science and the literary formations \nthey espoused were both changing. On the one side there was big \nscience (not so called at the time) and the nuclear issues, and the \nUK’s changing role in the post-war world, which Snow got at only \nvery imperfectly (and from a perspective that is now difficult to \nunderstand). And on the other side a change in relative values of \nvarious literary formations, including the emergence of powerful \nnew forces within them such as structuralism/post-structuralism with \nits challenge to such English and ‘English’ values as ‘universal’ \nhumanism, and, eventually, to humanism itself. Leavis and Snow \nwere arguing about divisions and boundaries, and about a set of \nassociated values, and rules for setting values, that were all already \nchanging rapidly; the ground was moving under their feet. As Mat-\nthews points out, neither Leavis’ high style nor the ethnographic \nrealism Snow adopted in his literary endeavours found connections \nwith, for instance, the Angry Young Men, whose work had already \nenergized the cultural scenes of the 1950s. Matthews claims that \nthe ‘importance of the literary critical field’ was ‘already waning’ \nby that mid-1960s, and that this waning was ‘caught up in the Two \nCultures debate’ (Matthews, 2004: 62); for him it is partly why the \ndebate happened. Others too, have noted that the Two Cultures \ndebate was one occurring within the establishment, that it took \nplace whilst (other) events and other groups, less parochial than \n Polemical acts of rare extremism  161\nSnow (with his limited sense of globality) and more cosmopolitan \nthan Leavis (with his insistent sense of English culture) were emerging. \nThese events were challenging the definitions of ‘science’, and the \nboundaries of ‘community’, and the relationship between community \nand nation, and the normative constitution of ‘the individual’ – \nscientist or not.\nSnow and Leavis argued about the primacy of particular views \nof the world; about the right or even the capacity of the scientist \nor the literary intellectual to hold the future in his hand. And here, \nas a pointer to a series of exclusions that need to be marked, we \nmight turn to gender – and return once again to the peculiarly \npersonalized terms of the old debate. That is, we might ask who is \nthe science professor of C.P. Snow’s lament? What do we know of \n‘him’, in ‘human’ terms? Only three things: that he speaks ‘science’ \n(‘this he will understand’), that he is a man with a wife (‘the reciprocal \nof pi to your good wife’), that he wishes to enter the common room \non equal terms with those others in the arts who can lay claim to \nit, perhaps those who (may) have wives to talk of. Those, then, who \nare – normatively/overwhelmingly – men, not women.\nPerhaps this seems like a diversion. Let me divert further. In a \nreview of Brenda Maddox’s book on DNA scientist Rosamund \nFranklin and her work with Watson and Crick, Sarah Delamont \nconsiders the question of how to assess Franklin and her work on \nDNA in relation to gender issues. She notes Maddox’s claim that \nWatson thought about calling his double helix book Honest Jim \n– after Kingsley Amis’ novel title, Lucky Jim. Maddox also suggests \nthat Watson’s destructive ‘caricature’ of Franklin in his book is very \nlike that of Margaret Peel in Lucky Jim. The academic on whom \nPeel was based (Larkin’s lover) was also caricatured in Bradbury’s \nEating People Is Wrong, which is also a Flanders and Swann song \nline. Catch a breath. As Delamont notes, such stereotypes (and I \nonly gesture here to how Delamont’s crawl might be extended still \nfurther) constitute a ‘salutary reminder of how deep misogyny ran \nin British universities in the 1950s, in both of C.P. Snow’s Two \nCultures’ (Delamont, 2003: 315). This was always a conversation \namongst men. Two public school boys on stage, and two old grammar \nboys in different common rooms, even if one of them claimed he \nwas always an outsider, constituted two sides of a shared and in \nmany ways exclusive world.\n162 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nThe scandal of the Profumo affair (of which Flanders and Swann \nsang obliquely in ‘Horoscope’ and ‘Madeira’), and the changing \nrole of ‘sexual intercourse’ in public culture in England, might be \nused to mark the beginnings of a shift. When somewhat later the \nTwo Cultures began to be explored or contested in relation to the \nbuilding of a different kind of ‘science as culture’ it was feminists \nwho were often central to this inquiry; and feminist theory that was \ninfluential. The question of automation and control – of what it \nmight mean, of how we might respond, if we were children, or \nwomen, or new kinds of hybrids or cybrids finding ourselves ‘in the \narms of automation’, could be, and was, posed in very different \nways only shortly after the Two Cultures debate. Notably the project \nto develop new kinds of (British) cultural studies, formally set up \nat Birmingham with a grant of £2,400 from Penguin Books in 1963, \nand a remit to cover everything from ‘Leavis to the News of the \nWorld’ (Guardian, 1963), came to disavow largely its Leavisite roots \nand to cleave to a left rather than a liberal agenda. It also became \na hub for much work on feminism, and for much feminist work \n– but only when cultural studies itself had been, as Stuart Hall put \nit much later – broken into.\nConclusions\nTaking seriously the Leavisite side of these debates, exploring the \npossibilities arising out of radical nostalgia, and attempting to \nunderstand or acknowledge the pain of change in a time of trans -\nformation, partly using Flanders and Swann to link into a minor \nkey sensibility of the period, might provide a restitutive reading of \nLeavis’ arguments in the Two Cultures; the decision to attack Snow \npersonally appears in a different light as it becomes oddly impersonal. \nHowever, both sides of the debate threaten to resolve into each \nother; Leavis’ fervour and Snow’s brashness merge. Snow’s demand \nfor change is really a demand for continuity, and the radicalism in \nLeavis’ demand for the future as human (the ultimate continuity) \nis lost because his sense of the force of the past and its capacity to \nintervene in the future is undermined by the limitations of his \nuniversalist (but in fact chauvinistically local) sense of human culture; \n Polemical acts of rare extremism  163\nthe insistence on English, always a struggle to comprehend, in the \nend becomes a sign of parochialism rather than a radical attack on \nelites that seeks to undermine their privilege and their insistent \ndemands for unexamined ‘progress’ at any cost.\nHowever, if Leavis’ thinking is unfashionable within most academic \nspheres and is virtually ignored in relation to questions of technology \nas these are related to digital cultures, it does nonetheless find echoes \ntoday. The anxieties Leavis articulated persist and frequently return, \nresonating with new forms of 21st-century modes of technological \nhostility. Where would the Leavisite objection to technologico-\nBenthamism and its indifferent standardization, the global extension \nof a nonetheless nationally chauvinistic position, and the nostalgically \npowered defence of a folk and a land find its resonances today? \nNot only as a sensibility but as the re-constitution of a more active \nformation in response to that? One immediate answer in an England \nin post-Brexit referendum times is in new forms of national politics \n– perhaps, and sometimes despite the intentions of those holding \nsuch positions, a politics with its attractions for those of the new  \nRight.\nNotes\n1 ‘inciting England’ s intellectuals to polemical acts of rare extremism’ \n(Mulhern, 1979: 305).\n2 See Raymond Williams (2017) on middlebrow.\n3 The ir set included curtains, a piano, and a domestic lightshade – if not \na common room, then its domestic counterpart, the drawing room.\n4 ‘Nature is the expression of a definite order with which nothing interferes,  \nand … the chief business of mankind is to learn that order and govern \nthemselves accordingly … this scientific “criticism of life” presents \nitself to us with different credentials from any other. It appeals not to \nauthority, nor to what anybody might have thought or said, but to \nnature’ (Huxley, 1881: 15).\n5 ‘The two cultures’, a phrase with an ‘enduring afterlife’ (Peter Dizikes, \nNew York Times, 19 March 19 th, 2009).\n6 W illiams himself has been termed a ‘left Leavisite’ and New Left Review \nwas intended to fuse Leavisite literary criticism with radical left politics \n(see Milner, 2002: 25).\n164 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\n7 Also printed in The New Statesman and Nation  in 1956.\n8 The Guardian commented somewhat snidely that it was ‘almost the only \n‘posh’ paper not attacked by the doctor in the lecture’ (Yesteryears of \nSnow), and also noted that The Spectator was published in the heart \nof Bloomsbury.\n9 Snow had delivered his lecture in a style that alternated between self-\npreening earnestness and airy high-table bonhomie. The position of the \nRede lecturer, however, is one that is implicitly congratulatory (Leith, \n2009).\n10 Leavis also commented on railways in ‘One Culture’, citing Dickens \n(Leavis, 2013: 95).\n11 ‘modernity’ – tin cans and computers.\n12 ‘I am thinking again of what Scrutiny stood  – and stands  – for: of the \ncreative work it did on the contemporary intellectual-cultural frontier \nin maintaining the critical function.’\n13 A few years after the Richmond Lecture Leavis would respond to \nHarold Wilson’s ‘white heat’ speech and the agenda it promoted.\n14 ‘If one points out that the actual history has been, with significance \nfor one’s apprehension of the full human problem, incomparably and \npoignantly more complex than that, Snow dismisses one as a “natural \nLuddite”’ (Leavis, 2013: 70).\n15 George Martin produced the Hat LPs.\n16 V ia the obscure interjection ‘Oh, Beatles – nothing!’\n17 ‘And universal Darkness cover all’ (Alexander Pope, The Dunciad).\nBibliography\nAmigoni, David. 2011.

[First published 1958]\nChapter 6\nApostasy in the temple of technology: \nELIZA the more than  \nmechanical therapist\nWhat is it about the computer that has brought the view of man as \na machine to a new level of plausibility? (Weizenbaum, 1976: 1–16)\nWe, all of us, have made the world too much into a computer, and … \nthis remaking of the world in the image of the computer started long \nbefore there were any electronic computers. (Weizenbaum, 1976: ix)\nWhat happens when technophilia falls out of love with its object? \nIn the early 1970s, Joseph Weizenbaum, a computer scientist at the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), an institution ‘proudly \npolarized’ around technology, wrote a script for a ‘computer program \nwith which one could “converse” in English’ (Weizenbaum, 1976: \n371). This program, strictly speaking a language analyser and script,1 \nbecame famous as a chatbot (Wardrip-Fruin and Montfort, 2003) \nand was once labelled ‘the most widely quoted computer program in \nhistory’ (Turkle, 2005: 39). ELIZA, whose name came from Shaw’s \nheroine in Pygmalion, carries out natural language conversations \nwith the user, inviting interaction through the ‘impersonation’ of \na Rogerian therapist (Wardrip-Fruin, 2009, Weizenbaum, 1976: 2). \nStrictly speaking, ELIZA was ELIZA playing DOCTOR (the script \nfor a therapist), but it was by that name that the program became \ncelebrated.\nWeizenbaum chose to give ELIZA this identity because of the kind \nof interaction that Rogerian therapy entails, involving extensive forms \nof mirroring of the patient by the therapist. Essentially it ‘draws out \nthe patient’ by ‘reflecting back’ (Weizenbaum, 1976: 3). This kind of \ndialogue is peculiarly amenable to computer simulation because it \nis open to wide input but demands a limited repertoire of responses \n(as output) and has a clear context (Weizenbaum, 1972 and 1976, \n Apostasy in the temple of technology  169\nTurkle, 2005). The kinds of responses that Eliza could produce \nmight seem less tendentious or eccentric in these circumstances.\nWeizenbaum always recognized that ELIZA had many limitations, \nbeing easily ‘persuaded’ to come out with clearly nonsensical answers \nor fall into recursive loops. ELIZA operated rather badly, he said, \ndoing far less than was popularly claimed – which was, at its most \nexaggerated, to have demonstrated a ‘general solution to the problem \nof computer understanding of natural language’, a key AI goal \n(Weizenbaum, 1976: 7). These limitations did not prevent ELIZA \nfrom becoming a phenomenon, generating discussion, hype, and \ndebate inside and outside specialist and public worlds. For Weizen-\nbaum this reception was egregious and damaging. It provoked a \npermanent and radical shift in his thinking around the relationship \nbetween humans and computers specifically, and humans and technol-\nogy more generally. As a direct response, he wrote Computer Power \nand Human Reason, an attack on the growing reliance on, and \npreference for, computational thinking in popular and specialist \ncircles. This was anti-computational thinking from a man at the \nheart of things, and constituted apostasy in the temple. It was a \ndirect attack on the ‘hubristic’ arguments of the fast-growing AI \ncommunity, or the artificial intelligentsia as Weizenbaum termed \nthem. He critiqued in particular the adherence of members of this \ncommunity to ‘the deepest and most grandiose fantasy that motivates \nwork on artificial intelligence … to build a machine on the model \nof a man … which can ultimately … contemplate the whole domain \nof human thought’ (Weizenbaum, 1976: 203–204).\nThis chapter begins by considering Weizenbaum’s critique of what \nhe understood as the prioritization of computational thinking over \nhuman reason. First, the roots of Weizenbaum’s change of heart \nand the development of the arguments in Computer Power are \nexplored. Second, I attend more closely to what ELIZA offered, \nwhich was, after all, and despite Weizenbaum’s protestations, \nsomehow a mode of ‘therapy’. Finally, I suggest, partly as a thought \nexperiment, that ELIZA, the famous bot psychiatrist, is itself con-\nflicted, dealing in narratives and yet operating in code. Was ELIZA \na computer with anti-computational impulses? If so, then Weizenbaum \nmight have taken solace from his own creation, even if he remained \nhorrified by the rise of machine thinking in general. At least in that, \nviewed this way, ELIZA was on his side.\n170 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nThe argument here is in dialogue with, and relates closely to, a \nparallel article exploring ELIZA in AI and Society (Bassett, 2019),3 \nwhich traces these ideas into the contemporary moment via an \nengagement with human ‘droning’ (Andrejevic, 2015) by exploring \nthe connections between this early form of automatic ‘therapy’ and \nthe modulation of selves through behaviouristic forms of ‘therapeutic’ \nnudge. Here I stay closer to the Weizenbaum/ELIZA events as they \nunrolled at the time. I am interested in the workings of apostasy; \nthe abandonment of a belief or principle, traditionally one that \npertained to religion. Being true to what you know, if that implies \na kind of camp loyalty as well as a form of expertise, turned out to \nbe impossible for Weizenbaum. On the other hand being true to its \n‘nature’ was, or so I am going to argue, a more complex issue in the \ncase of ELIZA than might at first appear. And ELIZA, at least as \nmuch as Weizenbaum, is the subject of this chapter. So, here goes.\nIn Computer Power and Human Reason Weizenbaum listed \nthree things he found shocking about ELIZA’s celebrity reception. \nThe first was that ordinary people related to ELIZA as if it was \na ‘real’ therapist. The second was that ELIZA was given a warm \nreception from some in the world of professional therapy. The third \nwas that what ELIZA could do technically was misunderstood and \nexaggerated. Weizenbaum always maintained that ELIZA’s capacity \nto act as a therapeutic mirror was extremely limited and that the \nrole was chosen ‘for convenience’, as an aid to researching natural \nlanguage processing and not with the aim of developing working \nartificial therapy tools. However limited it was, the program held up \na mirror reflecting expert and public understandings of, and hopes \nfor, technology. What Weizenbaum saw reflected there provoked \nhim to speak out.\nComputer Power and Human Reason was a best-seller, a narrative \nof conversion that attempts to convert in its turn. It is at once, and \navowedly, a personal account, an expert intervention, a mode of \npublic science, even a science literacy project. In it Weizenbaum \nbinds his thinking into philosophical critiques of technocratic \nrationality but also names himself as part of another tradition. He \ninvokes Mumford, Arendt, Ellul, and Roszak, amongst others, as \nkey critical thinkers of the technological with whom some of his \npositions intersect, but speaks as a scientist rather than a philosopher. \nIndeed, it is because he is a scientist that he feels he needs to speak, \n Apostasy in the temple of technology  171\nand may speak with some authority.4 He thus finds an appropriate \nforebear in the Soviet scientist Polyani, who began as a physical \nchemist but later became chiefly a lifelong critic of ‘the mechanical \nconception of man’; Polyani’s response to the Soviet leader Bukharin’s \ncontention that science for its own sake would disappear ‘under \nsocialism’ was that (Soviet) socialism’s ‘scientific outlook’ was in \ndanger of producing ‘a mechanical conception of man and history \nin which there was no place for science itself … nor … any grounds \nfor claiming freedom of thought’ (cited in Weizenbaum, 1976: 1). \nWeizenbaum’s thinking ran along similar lines, as we will see, but \nthere was another resonance too; Polyani’s decision to respond to \nBukharin’s provocation led to a lifelong change of direction, demand-\ning ‘his entire attention’, even if he had originally intended to ‘have \ndone with it in short order’ (Weizenbaum, 1976: 2), and even at \nthe time of writing Computer Power Weizenbaum felt himself to \nbe reliving this trajectory. By the second decade of the 21st century \nhis reputation rests far more on his critique of computation than it \ndoes on his substantial contribution to computer science and natural \nlanguage processing.\nComputer Power attacked forms of ‘powerful delusional thinking’ \nabout computers, their capacities, their limits, and their possible \nimpacts, said to be then circulating in expert and public realms. \nThe concern was that they lent credence to, and might accelerate, \na broader form of scientism that was already very pronounced. This \nattack is two pronged; a critique of various ways in which computers \nare being thought about is undertaken and computer thought itself \nis reconsidered. At the heart of the matter, in both cases, is the \ncontention that human thought and AI cannot be equated, so that \none may not entirely substitute for the other. This translates into \nan inquiry into ‘whether or not human thought is entirely computable’ \nor reducible to logical formalism, the latter characterizing AI and/\nor generally taken to constitute its ontology.5 Weizenbaum’s argument \nwas that computer logics/logical formalism will always be ‘alien’ to \nhuman forms of rationality and that the failure to recognize fun-\ndamental differences between human rationality and computational \nreasoning produces errors in (technical) understanding, and a series \nof social pathologies. Moreover, so his argument went, this error \nwas already widespread in his time, being evidenced in over-optimistic \nexpectations for AI, in behaviourism as a tool for social order and \n172 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\na way of understanding humans; in the spread, in other words, of \nsystems thinking and those ‘mechanical conceptions’ of man that, \nearlier, Polyani too had feared. More proximately, it was evidenced \nin the responses to ELIZA, which demonstrated the currency of this \nkind of thinking, as well as threatening to contribute to it.\nLogical formalism?\n‘First there is a difference between man and machine.’ It was Wei -\nzenbaum’s understanding of what machine logic is that led him to \nargue for an essential difference between humans and machines, for \nrecognition of the division between rational thought and logical \noperations, and, following on from that, to make a call for limits \nto the spheres of operation in which the application of machine \nlogics should go ahead. Key to this was an attack on what Weizen-\nbaum termed the ‘rationality-logicality’ equation. This is the tendency \nto presume that human rationality and its operations can be reduced \nto, or can be equated with, or treated as, a question of logic and \nits operations – and that this can be operationalized. For Weizenbaum \nit cannot. There is an ontological distinction between human intel -\nligence (and human rationality) and computer logic, and because \nof that also a difference between computer operations which may \nentail forms of emergence (today that issue arises in terms of machine \nlearning) and human becoming.\nWeizenbaum’s argument doesn’t rely on the outcome, successful \nor otherwise, of various tests based on simulation (the Turing test \nbeing the most obvious example). In this he more or less follows \nSearle (1980), who is invoked in Computer Power. Nor is the issue \npurely a matter of the possible technical limits to AI development, \nor certainly not as these were invoked by Dreyfus around the same \ntime (Dreyfus, cited in Weizenbaum, 1976: 12). Nor is it relevant \nwhether or not AI could become complex enough to produce an \nadequately convincing simulation of humans; for Weizenbaum,  \n‘[e]ven if computers could imitate man in every respect – which in \nfact they cannot – even then it would be appropriate … urgent … \nto examine the computer in the light of man’s perennial need to \nfind his place in the world’ (Weizenbaum, 1976: 12).\n Apostasy in the temple of technology  173\nWeizenbaum did accept that imitation approaches were likely to \nprogress, that computers would come to ‘internalize ever more \ncomplex and more faithful models of ever larger slices of reality’ \n(Weizenbaum, 1972: 175), but believed this process would hit limits. \nHis argument entailed first, a general take on computer processing \nas a mode of formalization, and second, a consideration of processing \nitself as a mode of formalization that always entails a form of \nabstraction and therefore a reduction; there is always a gap between \nwhat is represented, or symbolized (formalized or encoded) and the \nsubject of such operations – for instance, the human or human \nthought processes. This understanding set Weizenbaum against AI’s \nbasic tenets, as the psychologist Sherry Turkle noted in her 1980s \nconsideration of ‘second selves’, pointing out that AI has historically \nasserted ‘the primacy of the program’. The AI method, that is, \n‘follows from the assumption that what looks intuitive can be formal-\nized, and that if you discover the right formalization you can get a \nmachine to do it’. It was a belief in the generalizability of the program, \nor system (cybernetics is clearly relevant here), that allowed AI to \nproclaim itself, ‘as psychoanalysis and Marxism had done, as a new \nway of understanding almost everything’ 6 (Turkle, 2005: 245–246).\nSimulation criterion as a test for intelligence (or a test for successful \nformalization) follows from this worldview, and, as Turkle noted, \nAI communities tended to accept the simulation criterion (Turkle, \n2005: 267). Simulation as a test for intelligence was rejected by \nWeizenbaum because he didn’t believe in the rationality-logicality \nequation (what we might define as the generalizability of the AI \nformalization of intelligence). In particular, he didn’t believe human \nrationality could be systematized, certainly not as, or through, \n‘logicality’ or forms of machinic systematization. As he put it, ‘hardly \nany’ of man is determined by ‘a small set of formal problems’ but, \nrather, by his (sic) intelligence. The consequence is that ‘every other \nintelligence, however great, must necessarily be alien to the human \ndomain’ (Turkle, 2005: 223).\nTurkle explicitly links Weizenbaum’s sense of the ‘un-codable’ \nnature of the human to Searle’s famous Chinese room argument, \nthe end point of which is that a computer simulation of thought is \nnot thought. In simulation, intelligent machines ‘will only be simulat-\ning thought’ (Weizenbaum, 1976: 263, Searle, 1980). What is being \n174 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\ncontested here is partly that line of thinking that says the program \nis not only a way to understand how to model human behaviour \nbut how to account for what it is. Or does. If simulation is an \nacceptable criterion it is because if it operates successfully; if the \nprogram runs, if it plays, then that is enough. For Weizenbaum, \nhowever, the model (perhaps any model) is not the reality. Moreover, \nand specifically in relation to the modelling of the human, Weizen-\nbaum followed the line that said, given the particular and singular \ncharacter of human intelligence, it may never be possible to convinc-\ningly model that reality. His critique of abstraction in general was \nthus supplemented by his sense that the sum of human knowledge \n(or knowledge about what the human is) could never be encoded \nin information structures. Why? Because ‘there are things human \nbeings know by virtue of having a human body, or as a consequence \nof having been treated as human beings by other human beings’ \n(Weizenbaum, 1976: 209). Moreover, even those things that seem \ncommunicable through language alone, not appearing to rely on \nembodiment, necessarily invoke it – even if in a distanced way.\nWeizenbaum, surprisingly perhaps, invoked Shannon’s information \nmodel, noting that even here the expectation of the receiver and \ntheir history are relevant to what is communicated. Translating this \ninto the register of communication and memory, he commented that \n‘the human use of language manifests human memory … giving rise \nto hopes and fears’, but then shifts the focus from memory and the \npast into a comment on the place of the future in human thought. \nHis argument essentially was that, across time, in relation to each \nother, through their embodied state, and by virtue of these relations/\nlocations, humans are always ‘in a state of becoming’ and always \nin a state of becoming which rests on humanity, on the human \n‘seeing himself, and … being seen by other human beings, as a \nhuman being’ (Weizenbaum, 1976: 223). It is human becoming, \nwhich constitutes human rationality, that cannot be reduced to \nmachine learning. For Weizenbaum, it would be ‘hard to see what \nit could mean to say a computer hopes’ (Weizenbaum, 1976:  \n207).\nWeizenbaum did not deny that the advent of AI, defined as a \n‘subdiscipline of computer science’ (Weizenbaum, 1976: 8), had \nchanged human–machine relations, nor that it might redefine human-\nto-human relationships and/or human relationships or interactions \n Apostasy in the temple of technology  175\nwith the world. The adoption of a medium-focused model to explore \nthis is striking. What is described is a particularly tight ‘coupling’, \na binding7 to the machine, a specific mode of prosthesis operating \ndifferently from earlier forms of human–technology interaction, \nengaging directly (human) ‘intellectual, cognitive, and emotive func-\ntions’ (Weizenbaum, 1976: 9). This coupling is partly why the \ncomputer is such a powerful new instrument and why the specific \nquestion of limits arises as a proximate necessity. Weizenbaum’s \nanswer to the question of what it means to be a human being and \nwhat it means to be a computer is thus that these two forms of \nbeing, and the forms of intelligence they bear, are fundamentally \ndistinct. One state of being cannot be rendered into another. The \ntrouble begins first when computers and humans move close to one \nanother, or are bound to one another in new ways, and when it is \nassumed, perhaps partly as a consequence of this relation, that this \nbinding should become increasingly tight. His second concern was \nthat this binding up does not produce an exchange, or make a new \ncommon ground, but produces a shift towards formalization, or \nthe adoption of computer or machine models as ways to understand \nthe world and/or to make it operational.\nMachine metaphors\nWeizenbaum, then, was concerned with accelerating computer power \nbut also saw limits to the goals of the ‘artificial intelligentsia’: this is \nnot an account fearful of the ‘rise of the machines’ to become our \nnew overlords. Weizenbaum was afraid of what he had produced and \nwanted to cut it down to size despite knowing it to be technically \nlimited, and incapable of much that was claimed for it. His concern \nwas that humans were already living as if the promises of AI were \nreal, already taking their logics for granted. He feared a world in \nwhich humans ‘come to yield … [their] … autonomy to a world \nviewed as machine’ (my italics). Something about the computer he \nknew had given this view ‘a new level of plausibility’(Weizenbaum, \n1976: 8), and after ELIZA he urgently wanted to understand what \nthat something was; the more urgently because its effects were being \nfelt not only in computer science and AI fields, but also amongst \ntherapists and the general public.\n176 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nIf Weizenbaum was horrified by the apparent alacrity with which \na bad model was accepted, and an unfortunate metaphor (his \ndescription of ELIZA’s designation ‘therapist’) taken up, it was also \nbecause he felt this betrayed a wish to believe, a wish to lean on \ncomputational intelligence, a lack of humans’ confidence in their \nown being, an increasing belief in the superiority of other (scientific, \nmachinic, exact) forms of reasoning, calculation, determination, \nand an apparent desire to rewrite the social world to reflect these \nforms. The seeming ease with which the replacement of people with \ncomputers could be contemplated troubled him, producing urgent \nquestions of the relationship between the individual and the computer \nand ‘the proper place of computers in the social order’.\nThe trouble began with computer science and AI where the \nrationality-logicality equation was being operationalized and pro -\nmoted. If rationality is understood in terms of logicality, then the \nproposition that human thought is computable becomes easy to \naccept. Weizenbaum’s objections to this position, strikingly close \nto some currently recapitulated in relation to big data, led him \nto consider a broader shift, the diminution or termination of the \nhuman’s role in ‘giving meaning to his world’, that function now \nbeing taken over by the computing machine (Weizenbaum, 1976: \n9). The logico-rationality ‘equation’ would not produce an equal \nexchange but a prioritization of one set of values over the other. \nComputational, or, speaking simply, ‘scientific’ thinking, prioritizes \nlogical operations and the knowledge they produce. Weizenbaum \nnoted the degree to which young computer science scholars had \n‘rejected all ways but the scientific to come to know the world’, but \nwas more worried that this orientation had diffused still further and \nwas widely observable. Science, whose values he has championed, \nin whose temple he still lives,8 had, he said, become a ‘slow acting \npoison’ (Weizenbaum, 1976: 1–16),9 challenging and transforming \nhuman activities and values across a wide range of fields because \nit offers a particular understanding of humans and social worlds as  \nmachines:\nthe attribution of certainty to scientific knowledge by the common \nwisdom, an attribution now made so nearly universally that it has \nbecome a commonsense dogma, has virtually delegitimized all other \nways of understanding. (Weizenbaum, 1976: xx)\n Apostasy in the temple of technology  177\nPart of Weizenbaum’s fear was that this rendered governmentality \ninhuman. Social and human contradictions and antagonisms become \n‘merely apparent contradiction[s]’, to be viewed as problems that \n‘could be untangled by judicious application of cold logic derived \nfrom some higher standpoint’. If rational argumentation is really \nonly ‘logicality’, which follows if rationality itself has been ‘tragically \ntwisted so as to equate it with logicality’ (my italics), then real \nhuman conflicts are to be viewed as simply ‘failures of communication’ \nto be sorted by ‘information handling techniques’. More fundamen-\ntally, if there are no ‘human values’ that are incommensurate, that \nare not sortable by machine, then ‘the existence of human values \nthemselves’ is in doubt (Weizenbaum, 1976: 13–14).\nMechanical humans and ‘automatic good’\nNow to return to ELIZA and the reception accorded to this most \nnotorious script. How could so much be hung on such a flimsy piece \nof work? What could a piece of work like ELIZA do that mattered? \nMy sense is that ELIZA’s pertinence came about at least partly because \nof that something Weizenbaum always wished to downplay, indeed \nbitterly regretted having assisted in producing; he gave ELIZA to \nthe world as a therapist. And the program was often received as \nsuch. Reflecting back on ELIZA, Sherry Turkle notes that ‘ELIZA \nwas a dumb program’, but adds that it was one that ‘sophisticated \nusers’ could relate to ‘as though it did understand, as though it \nwere a person’ (Turkle, 2005: 40, 39).10 Weizenbaum had earlier \nnoted with exasperation that well-educated people, even computer \nscience specialists and those in circles that might be expected (he \nfelt) to know better, found something compelling, and personal, \nabout their interactions with ELIZA. Notoriously, his secretary asked \nhim to leave the room whilst she ‘talked’ to ELIZA. Weizenbaum \nunderstood this partly in terms of a misplaced anthropomorphism \n(Weizenbaum, 1976: 6) taking the form of what might be termed \nreciprocal imprinting; having no better model, humans seeking to \nunderstand machine intelligence tended to draw on the only model \nof intelligence to hand – their own.\nThe transposition human–machine also worked the other way \naround – when it meant understanding humans in machine terms. \n178 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nThis disturbed Weizenbaum still more, particularly when he discerned \nit circulating amongst people who claimed expertise in understanding \nwhat makes humans, rather than machines, ‘tick’ – to invoke a \ncomparison he would presumably have hated. Thus, in the opening \npages of Computer Power Weizenbaum invoked the psychiatrists \nwho ‘believed’ the DOCTOR computer program could grow into a \n‘nearly complete’ automatic form of psychotherapy (Weizenbaum, \n1976: 3), incredulous that this group, of all people, could ‘view \nthe simplest mechanical parody of a single interviewing technique \nas having captured anything of the essence of a human encounter’. \nHe concluded that it was possible only because they must already \nthink of themselves as ‘information processor[s]’, adding that therapy \ndid already have a mechanical conception of the human to hand in \nthe behaviourist theories of B.F. Skinner (Weizenbaum, 1972: 175, \n1976). It also had an informational model of the human to draw \non in developing AI and computational science research, notably \nat MIT itself, where Marvin Minsky had defined the human as a \n‘meat machine’ (see also Weizenbaum, 1972: 160).\nWeizenbaum’s resistance to automatic therapy plugs in to fierce \ndebates within therapeutic circles that were circulating at the time of \nELIZA’s launch. Central here was the rise of behaviourism, notably \nas espoused by Skinner. Skinnerian behaviourism is noted for its \nrejection of an inner self as motivating human actions and its focus \non genetic endowment and environment. The key to psychological \nchange in this form of intervention is conditioning via environmental \nmodification, with the aim being the production of positive feedback \nloops that generate new forms of good behaviour (Skinner, 1971, \nBassett, 2019). Behaviourism thus reduces the human to an element \nwithin a system that may be stimulated and adjusted as necessary \nto produce the desired/desirable outcomes. Notoriously, Skinner \ncame to define this as ‘automatic goodness’, elaborating the term \nin Beyond Freedom and Dignity (Skinner, 1971), published within \nthree or four years of Human Reason, and linking it explicitly to \nforms of governance. Time magazine summed up its message as: \n‘familiar to followers of Skinner, but startling to the uninitiated: \nwe can no longer afford freedom, and so it must be replaced with \ncontrol over man, his conduct, and his culture’ (Time, 1971).\nBehaviourism’s refusal of agency, its denial of the self, its desire to \ndelegate matters of decision around good and evil to agencies beyond \n Apostasy in the temple of technology  179\nthe individual human, was anathema to many. It was challenged by \nleft theorists, including Noam Chomsky,11 for its societal implications \nand for the morality of its desire to replace freedom with condition-\ning as a form of social control (Chomsky, 1971a, 1971b, Bassett,  \n2019).\nAnother notable critic was Carl Rogers, whose eponymous approach \nto therapy at the time was focused on self-actualization, stressing the \ngrowth of the self and self-autonomy. Rogerian therapy was person \ncentred. In contrast to behaviour-modification programmes designed \nto change actions in the external world, it explored projects of work \non the self, to be undertaken by the subject with self-actualization \nas the goal (Rogers, 2004). The latter was defined by Rogers as:\n… the curative force in psychotherapy … man’s tendency to actualize \nhimself, to become his potentialities … to express and activate all the \ncapacities of the organism. (Rogers, 1954: 251)\nSkinner and Rogers later debated their positions in public (see e.g. \nA Dialogue on Education and Control, Skinner and Rogers, 1976), \nwith Skinner defending the virtues of ‘automatic goodness’ and \ndemanding recognition of its necessity in a complex society, where \nfreedom could not be afforded. Rogers was horrified by the implica-\ntions of understanding human motivations and actions in machinic \nways, as only matters of response to stimuli, and by what followed \n– which was that therapy, or more broadly the therapeutic modulation \nof human behaviour to make a better society, would then best consist \nof the appropriate modulation of conditions to encourage correct \nforms of behaviour for individuals and also groups. He insisted on \nthe need for thinking through matters of orientation, decision, agency \nand freedom. Rogerian therapy does not turn the human into an \nobject, thereby diminishing their agency, but on the contrary seeks \nto allow growth.\nSo what kind of therapist was ELIZA? One the one hand, a \nlanguage analyser and script; a piece of code operating to parse \nspeech and offer appropriate responses, a bot designed to host \ninteractions, where formally speaking meaning – understanding – has \nnot been designed in. To process natural language does not entail \nunderstanding it – not then, not now. On the other hand, ELIZA \nhad been designated Rogerian, and not simply designated, but also \ndesigned to operate, as a Rogerian. If the program had a goal it was \n180 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nto offer such therapy (or simulate such a therapeutic response) or, in \nother words, to help ‘users’ self-actualize, to understand themselves \nbetter, to know their own stories. Code and machine, database and \nnarrative: I have argued elsewhere that the one and the other are \nnot discrete, and also that one survives the rise of the other (Bassett, \n2007). Here we might say that ELIZA provided or enabled both for \nher users. Or perhaps we can say He/She/It was conflicted; not the \nstatus a therapist is meant to admit to but, rather, to diagnose (but \nthen, don’t all therapists have their own supervisors?). Is this simply \na fantasy? Weizenbaum said ELIZA’s designation wasn’t intended \nto be taken seriously, the burden of his argument being, perhaps, \nthat the program was designed to be illustrative (of how a natural \nlanguage processing issue could be addressed in relation to a human \nfunction), rather than performative (acting out a role and producing \nwhat it helped to name).\nIt could be concluded, then, that ELIZA simulated a (Rogerian-\nstyle) therapist rather too successfully for Weizenbaum’s liking. But it \nis also possible to conclude that an assemblage that included ELIZA \n(providing one form of cognitive input) and human users did, in \noperation, enable forms of reflection or exchange that might produce \ninsight or growth, and that these exchanges need to be considered \nas neither entirely ‘alien’ nor wholly (if wholly implies exclusively) \n‘human’. ELIZA was made of code, language, an analyser and a \nparser, and in this sense could offer only a machinic view of the \nworld, but what the program was programmed to do, or ‘be’, was \nRogerian; it was programmed not to modulate but to ‘listen’, to \nreflect back, and prompt introspection, self-inspection, self-growth. \nWhen Turkle talked to doctoral students at MIT about ELIZA \nshe concluded that they liked talking to a machine, partly because \nthey weren’t happy with humans. But another conclusion might be \nthat these students engaged with an interlocutor to develop their \nthinking/selves. This is far from Skinnerian pigeon boxes, cybernetic \nloops involving the adjustment of behaviour through the delivery \nof external stimuli, routing entirely around the sense of self. Put \nthis another way: what did those people, in front of the mirror, do? \nThey told ELIZA stories about themselves. ELIZA invites narrative.\nIf ELIZA is a narrative machine, then we might suggest that the \nprogram is in conflict with what its ontology seems to suggest; there \nis some hope here that because we are humans we can make of \n Apostasy in the temple of technology  181\nmachines – and of machine prosthesis, that magical bind – something, \nsome form of engagement, that is new. Human becoming is not \nmachine emergence, but the two together might be something else \nagain.\nThis invites reconsideration of what it means to be anti-computing, \nor even what it means that what we make with computers is often \napparently in tension with what is conventionally assumed to be \nessential to the computational: its inescapable logico-rationality. \nThe latter is in evidence, but also in evidence is an imaginary, a \nsymbolic, a form of putting into practice, or becoming through \nmediation, which is a coming into the world. The computational \nas instantiated, because instantiated, contains something of its own \ncontradictions. What this opens the door to is a way of rethinking \nanti-computing not in terms of appropriate use and appropriate \nlimits (where Weizenbaum ends), but perhaps rather as something \nintegral, something reflecting the difficulties, or ambiguities of a \ncomplex prosthesis, a prosthetic arrangement, which may still be \nworth undertaking. To consider the ways in which a machine might \nconflict with its own ontology – how it might be anti-computing, \nconsidered in its own terms, not as a rational choice, but through \nhow its logics are operationalized – comes close to identifying a \nform of essential indeterminacy, in process if not in use.\nThe conclusion of Computer Power and Human Reason is a call \nfor recognition of a fundamental difference between alien and human \nthinking, and a call for limits to ‘what computers ought to be put \nto do’ (Weizenbaum, 1972: 16). This comes as a demand not for a \nformal limit on the development of particular computer capacities \nbut, rather, for a restriction on the areas in which they might be \nused. This makes sense, since for Weizenbaum, in the end, ‘the \nrelevant issues are neither technological, nor even mathematical but \nethical. If these issues are not addressed’, he concludes gloomily, it \nis because we have finally or already ‘abdicated to technology the \nvery duty to formulate questions’ (Weizenbaum, 1976: 611).\nIt would be possible to argue that Weizenbaum had only himself \nto blame for the ELIZA events. He had programmed his script to \nimitate a therapist, to mimic, that is, precisely that mode of interaction \nthat cleaves very closely to questions of ‘the human’, of ‘human \nbeing’, and of human thoughts, feelings, mind. Weizenbaum wrote \nof the ‘perverse proposition’ that a computer could be programmed \n182 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nto become an effective psychotherapist. (Weizenbaum, 1976: 206), \nbut this was what he had ‘asked’ ELIZA to do; in a sense, it was \nhis proposition. His apostasy perhaps arises partly because he felt \nresponsible for creating a (small) monster – a familiar-enough senti-\nment found amongst scientists who mess with ‘life’, and one explored \nextensively in fiction, from Frankenstein (and his parent) on. To \nbreak with Weizenbaum I have, rather than excoriating ELIZA as \nan unintentionally proffered accelerant for accelerationism/machine \nrationality whose influence came from her attributed capacities rather \nthan anything substantial, reconsidered what ELIZA did – and \nspecifically what ELIZA did as a therapist.\nAn afterword\nPlug & Play, a documentary directed by Jens Schanze, made many \nyears after the ELIZA events, intercuts interviews with Weizenbaum \nwith comments from Ray Kurzweil, the singularity champion, and \nHiroshi Ishiguro of the Bits and Atoms lab at MIT, still the temple \nof AI12 and the now the home of Ishiguro’s peculiar robot dop -\npelganger. In Plug & Play Weizenbaum affirmed his belief in human \ninexactitude, change, finitude, and argued passionately against the \ncharms of living forever. He died during the making of the film, his \nlife ending, or so we understand, somewhere near where he began \nit in Europe, as a Jewish kid – which is to say in history as well as \nin technology. The film ends with an empty chair, and with the \nsilence of Weizenbaum’s machines. In his absence they have nothing \nto say and are – disturbingly – not lively. Dead flesh and unliving \nmachines; there is a difference. ELIZA ‘lives’ on the internet. You \ncan visit her, have an audience in front of her Rogerian mirror, and \nwonder perhaps how she relates to Siri, Alexa, and her other later \nand more commercially minded and linked-in ‘sisters’.\nNotes\n1 ELIZA is a ‘language analyser’ and ‘script’. The latter is described by \nWeizenbaum as a set of rules ‘rather like those that might be given \n Apostasy in the temple of technology  183\nto an actor who is to use them to improvise around a certain theme’ \n(Weizenbaum, 1976: 3).\n2 www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/muiseum/weizenbaum/joseph_page.htm\n3 Elsewhere I have looked at further at the return to behaviourism, which \nhaunts this book, and haunts our current situation; from Facebook \nprompts to behavioural economics to or ‘hyper-nudge’ (see Yeung \n2012) – an increasingly automated affair. If we were drawing a line \nfrom the ELIZA moment today, and followed Weizenbaum, we might \nsee in contemporary developments the consummation of a particular \ntrajectory; a greater loss of self, and a massively accelerated adoption of \nmachine organization of individual and social behaviour. I’ve addressed \nthese strains elsewhere (Bassett, 2019).\n4 Weizenbaum is generally remembered as the expert, the insider, who \nchanged sides. An example is found in Wardrip-Fruin and Montfort’s \n(2003) collection, where his thinking is distinguished from ‘dire warnings’ \noften come from ‘non-computing users’ who have only superficially \nconsidered or even experienced new media.’ Lewis Mumford, for the \nhumanists, acknowledged that it sometimes matters that a member of \nthe scientific establishment says some things that humanists have been \n‘shouting about’ (quoted in Agassi, 1976).\n5 See Beatrice Fazi (2018) for an elegant demand to reconsider compu -\ntational determination.\n6 Turkle (2005: 246) footnotes that she uses the term AI to refer to ‘a \nwide range of computational processes, in no way limited to serial \nprograms written in standard programming languages’.\n7 This is oddly magical: a binding spell.\n8 The contexts of Weizenbaum’ s cogitations were painfully evident to \nhim. He worked and wrote at MIT and declared himself ‘professionally \ntrained only in computer science, which is to say (in all seriousness) \nthat I am extremely poorly educated’ (Weizenbaum, 1976: 371).\n9 On the genealogy of accounts of technology as cure or poison see also \nPlato, Derrida, Stiegler.\n10 Turkle claims that many people first became aware of hackers through \nWeizenbaum’s description of the hollow-eyed young men reminiscent \nof opium addicts and compulsive gamblers found at MIT.\n11 Noam Chomsky’s ‘The Case Against B.F . Skinner’, a review of Beyond \nFreedom and Dignity that amounted to a coruscating attack on the \nsocial programme of Skinnerism, set out to demolish its scientific rigour \nand denounce the morality of conditioning as a mode of social control \n(Chomsky, 1971b; see also Bassett, 2019).\n12 Where the future was ‘invented’, according to Stuart Brand’s (1998 \n[1987]) eponymous book.\n184 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nBibliography\nAgassi, Joseph. 1976. ‘Review of Computer Power and Human Reason: \nFrom Judgment to Calculation’, Technology and Culture, 17(4): 813–816.\nAndrejevic, Mark. 2015. ‘The Droning of Experience’, Fiberculture Journal, \n25: 187.\nBassett, Caroline. 2007.

SF claims a \nprivileged relationship to the technological future, and the tax on \ndissenting projections is lower than that for the apostates of computer \nscience and industry. More specifically, it claims the privilege that \ncomes with attention. It attends to the future, it explores, invents, \nand/or speculates on possible forms of life. Through the form of \nattention SF pays, it creates, it makes, and that which is made in \nfiction is made possible through the fictional, the speculative, the \nfantastical. The philosopher Paul Ricoeur argued that narrative may \nresolve the aporias of time by making these aporias productive on \nanother order of language. It is plausible to claim for SF, then, that \nit produces real (possible) futures in poesis. It is in this way also \nproducing accounts of the present. Recognizing the tendency of \nutopian and dystopian accounts to reverse their charge, this chapter \navoids polemical accounts of AI ‘life’ as good or evil and explores \naspects of the anti-computational in more ambiguous explorations \nof fictional future being.\n* * *\nI think hard times are coming when we will be wanting the voices \nof writers who can see alternatives to how we live now and can see \nthrough our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies.  W e \nwill need writers who can remember freedom. Poets, visionaries – the \nrealists of a larger reality. (Le Guin, 2014)1\n Those in love with quantum filth 187\nA widespread popular (and also literary) presumption is (still) that \nSF is enchanted with technology, dazzled by its shiny promise, its \nsolid materiality, and its capacity for inflicting lethal damage at new \nscales. For this reason it is often castigated for exhibiting an unex -\namined technophilia, and/or for adopting crude forms of technological \ndeterminism (the judgement pertaining to utopian and dystopian \nSF). The opposite view was promulgated by the novelist Ursula Le \nGuin, who near the end of her life declared that SF writers were \nimportant precisely because they can see beyond the enclosures of \ntechnocratic rationality and its temporal horizons. Warning against \nwhat she saw as the ‘obsessive technologies’ of a ‘fear-stricken society’, \nLe Guin argued that SF (she refused to divide ‘speculative’ and \n‘science’ fiction) constitutes a response to an extant mode of tech -\nnocratic domination. SF practitioners can gain an expert view of \nthe present because as the ‘realists of a larger reality’ they can generate \na complexity around thinking the technological that is lacking in a \nworld in which technology is obsessively lauded or relentlessly \nexcoriated. For Le Guin this is why SF can develop real alternatives \nto ‘how we live now’ – integral to which is what life itself is or \nmight become in the future. It is life and its fictional treatment that \nis the subject of this chapter. The focus is on singularity, defined as \nthat expected or feared moment when technological advancements \nmean that humanity augments either to the point of becoming \nsomething qualitatively new or is superseded and left behind by the \nrise of new forms of artificial consciousness. SF has long had dealings \nwith the tensions and paradoxes at the heart of singularity discourse, \nwith its demands to upgrade, augment, arise, upload, to create and/\nor terminate new and old forms of human and other life.\nIn this chapter, aspects of changing life are explored in Marge \nPiercy’s He/She/It (known in the UK as Body of Glass ), China \nMiéville’s Embassytown, and Hannu Rajaniemi’s Fractal Prince  \nseries. Between them they span almost twenty years, from early \ncyberspace and the first AI revival to today’s much larger re-emergence. \nThese bodies of work provide insights into how post-standard-human \nlife has been viewed as possible, viable, or desirable , and in what \nforms, at significant moments in the decades-long processes of \ncomputerization beginning around the early public internet/PC era \nand coming into the near present. In various ways they all exhibit \nsomething of the kind of ‘greater realism’ Le Guin advocates. This \n188 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nplaces them at some distance from the claims of singularity advocates, \nwhich lean for their authority on scientific discourse, and often on \nwhat Kate O’Riordan terms ‘unreal objects’ (O’Riordan, 2017); \nspeculative future technologies pulled into the present, as if they \nwere already fully functional, or as near as makes no difference. \nWhat is made for real in SF, which declares and rests upon its fic -\ntionality, it thus allowed to contrast with what is not yet made ‘for \nreal’ but yet claims to be non-fictional in discourses circulating \naround singularity science. Further, all the works invoked challenge \nthe position that the technologically given augmentation of human \nor machine intelligence is an automatic good, expressing ambivalence \nor dislike for, or suggesting the preferability of, particular forms of \nlife. I would argue that bound up with SF’s interest in, or excitement \naround, technology as an instrument of change there is always an \nimpulse that is more ambivalent or even hostile, that hostility as \nmuch as avidity is part of its genre identity, an unacknowledged or \nsequestered part of the broader range – and certainly not confined \nto fully dystopian SF.\nSingularity\nSingularity marks a tipping point. It is defined as that moment to \ncome when the rise of AI means that what it is to be human changes \nqualitatively. That is, we humans are changed, and/or our position \nin the world changes as a consequence of the rise of new kinds of \nintelligences that out-smart us. Singularity stands for the inauguration \nof that time in which, through the advancement of technology, \nhumans at once become more (because augmented) and less (since \nfurther from any baseline – or normative – model) than human. It \nalso refers to the break that occurs as AIs take on more or less \nconscious (or certainly highly agential) lives of their own. A long-\nstanding argument within transhumanism concerns the relative merits \nof continued embodiment, albeit in augmented form, versus various \nforms of uploading in which the human and/or flesh body is left \nbehind entirely (upload fantasies began early in singularity discourse, \nnotably in Ray Kurzweil’s writing (2005)). A singularity moment \nwould constitute an extreme transduction. It breaks out of any \n Those in love with quantum filth  189\npredictable temporal progression, not only being a matter of scaling \nup. Max Tegmark explores singularity as Life 3.0 and says it comes \nabout when ‘hardware dependence’ on the human body to support \nintelligent life is ended (Tegmark, 2018). Another advocate for \nsingularity-delivered transhumanism, Russell Blackford, concludes \nit will bring about ‘deeply altered people … continuous with us, \nbut unlike us in many ways’. He adds that ‘optimistically’, these \nnew people will be ‘us … greatly changed’; pessimistically, they are \nhumanity’s successors ‘a new race, the inheritors of the earth … \nusurpers’ (Blackford, 2013: 442). For hard singularity advocates \nthe question is not that singularity will come, but what happens \nwhen it does: augmentation or new life, expanded human or fully \nartificial being? A key marker of singularity discourse is its reliance \non big science and big industry, on digital, biotechnological, robotics, \nneuroscience enterprises to deliver on this future. This alignment \nhas consequences; it is not only the crude determinism of singularity \nscience as it is invoked by singularity advocates or believers that \njars with critically orientated theorizations of emerging techno-cultural \nchange, but often also its market-driven, neoliberal, or libertarian \npolitical orientations.\nCritical and cognitive theory and singularity\nCritical theory tends to distance itself from singularity science dis -\ncourses, particularly in their populist forms, whilst itself entertaining \na series of somewhat discrete positions. In an article in Existenz \nFrancesca Ferrando (2013) helpfully disambiguates by dividing \ntranshumanist thinking on singularity from forms of critical post-\nhumanism, which begin by decentring technology as the determining \ncause and then further dividing post-humanism approaches. Notably, \nanti-humanism is defined directly against transhumanism because it \nencapsulates approaches to thinking singularity that reach beyond \nsimple technical questions of augmentation/inauguration and its \ndiscontents/contents. Metahumanism, defined through the invoca-\ntion of del Val and Sorgner’s ‘A Metahumanist Manifesto’ (2011), \nis different again. Drawing on forms of more or less Deleuzian2 \nentanglement, it is against the prioritization of the shaping limits \n190 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nof the body (that which defines ‘the human’) in thinking about \nintelligent life, and against the invocation of human ideas of free will, \nautonomy, and rationality as distinctions that imply the superiority \nof the anthropoid over future forms of life. The meta-human body \nis thus regarded as post-anatomical, as marking a ‘development \naway from humanism’. Such a body cannot be individual. Thus a \n‘common relational body’ is postulated; this body is liberated from \nparticular kinds of bodily constraints (or disciplining), but it is also \nalways in danger of (re)appropriation (del Val and Sorgner, 2011).\nThe burden of Ferrando’s argument is that critical post-humanism, \nparticularly the metahuman variety, is better at grappling with \nemerging questions of human and post-human future existence than \ntranshumanism in any of its political ‘flavours’ (libertarian and/or \ndemocratic transhumanism, or extropianism), transhumanism being \ncompromised both by the degree to which it leans on science and \ntechnology and by the concealed ultra-humanism, or ‘fit for all’ idea of \nthe human, which it contains. These two issues, which are conjoined, \nseverely restrict transhumanism’s perspectives, rendering it unable \nto grapple with, let alone value, difference – racial, gendered, sexed, \naged, or in bodily or cognitive abilities. Metahumanism is not unique \nin its disdain for the technicist underpinnings of singularity science \nand its claims (covert or open) that technological transformation will \nindependently determine the post-human, anti-human, or meta-human \nfuture. Nor is it alone in envisaging future forms of future life that \nare less gross and coarse, less mechanically derived,3 than those of \nhard singularity. For many these forms are to be preferred.\nKatherine Hayles’ more or less cognitivist and literary engagements \nwith singularity and the post-human also begin by problematizing \ntranshumanism as a route to thinking about human futures (Hayles, \n1999, 2011). Her assessment of strong transhumanism as reductive \nand determinist in relation to its understanding of the technological, \nand too narrow and ideologically fraught (bound up with individual-\nism and neoliberal philosophy) to constitute a basis for fruitful \ndiscussion, is a common humanities response. Hayles, however, also \nacknowledges the pull of transhumanism, finding the basic assumption \n‘that technology is involved in a spiralling dynamic of co-evolution \nwith human development … [a] technogenesis’ compelling. The \nquestions the transhumanist community poses about technogenesis \nin the current era and in relation to human futures are worth worrying \n Those in love with quantum filth 191\nabout, she declares, not least because they are unresolved. Even so, \nfor Hayles, transhumanism is a catalyst or irritant stimulating more \n‘considered’ and ‘responsible’ views. These may be developed by \nway of ‘deep, rich and challenging contextualizations’ of singularity \nthat ‘re-introduce the complexities it strips away’. In other words, \nby exploring them through SF and literary theory.\nFor Hayles, SF constitutes a better resource to think seriously \nabout advanced technologies and the changes in human lives and \nculture they produce than anything an exclusive focus on technologies \nthemselves can provide (this is her reading of the singularity com -\nmunity’s approach). I would suggest that singularity science/singularity \ndiscourse is less purely technological than Hayles’ account implies. \nPartly by virtue of that it is also more important for critical thinking \nthan is often acknowledged. The gung-ho, non-consistent, hubristic, \nfantastical, heterodox admixture of ideas that circulate as singularity \ndiscourse give it a more than catalytic function – at least if the latter \nmeans it can stimulate (elsewhere) but not produce (for itself) a \nsingularity imaginary of some force. Indeed, contra Hayles’ declared \nintention of transplanting these debates into the ‘richer’ grounds of \nliterary theory, her own explorations often evidence an ongoing \nengagement with singularity discourse formations; this is one of \ntheir virtues. Her account of Nancy Kress’s Beggars in Spain (1993), \na work that deals in augmented humanity arising through sleeplessness \nand the time riches it produces, exposes brilliantly how Beggars is \nat once in dialogue with, and in revolt from, forms of the Ayn \nRand-influenced libertarianism that pervade transhumanist discourse. \nMy point is that if certain distance from, and disdain for, singularity \ndiscourse evident in critical theoretical or literary analytic writing \nis understandable, given singularity’s penchant for declaring the end \nof any kind of human capacity to make history at the hands of \ntechnology, this disdain is also somewhat disingenuous. It is from \ncomputing and biotech, and in popular and general-specialist readings \nof these fields; from a tangle of claims, demands, assumptions, \ntechnologies, predications about technology, that an energy fuelling \nclaims of post-humanity is found. Speculative and critical theory \nrespond to this energy and to the urgency of the claims it makes, \neven if in dissenting ways.\nSF itself may claim a kind of expertise in singularity. Suggesting \nthis might invoke genre trouble since SF, peculiarly self-aware as a \n192 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\ngenre, obsessed with making or breaking its own boundaries, has \nentertained fierce debates about the degree to which it relies on \nresources from beyond itself. An argument long influential was that \nadherence to credible scientific logics provided SF with epistemological \ngravity, a form of authority and grounding that anchored otherwise \nonly fantastical or incoherent worlds (Suvin, 1979). Those challenging \nthis argument (notably Bould and Miéville, 2009) convincingly argued \nthat magical thinking is at least as important to the constitution of \nSF worlds as science ‘itself’, something evident given that recourse \nmade to the latter in fiction is always to an imaginary science.4 Once \nthis is accepted, then the conventional divide between fantasy and \nSF (discussed further later) is breached, as Bould and Miéville (2009) \npointed out, and a standard and entirely inadequate model for \nexplaining how SF relates to technological futures by ‘inventing’ \nthem also falters (Bassett et al., 2013). These arguments have a \nparticular piquancy in relation to singularity discourse, because it \nis itself, despite its scientism, also and self-admittedly, a discourse \npartly produced through and as (science) fiction.\nHowever, if it is not tenable to hold that SF has a privileged \nrelation to singularity science because it has a deep knowledge of \nthis science, nor because the latter provides an epistemological gravity \nto anchor the writing, then I nonetheless assert that there is a kind \nof privileged or over-determined relation that pertains between SF \nand those questions with which singularity discourse concerns itself.\nTo build this case what is first necessary is an acknowledgement \nthat SF tends to have an over-determined relationship with trans -\nformed materials, environments, or material conditions, although \nthese materials do not have to be mechanical, artificial, or compu-\ntational. To accept this is simply to notice that SF is a literature of \ndifference and change. Technology co-constitutes our world and \norganizes and conditions how we lay hold of it – as may magic. \nThis claim enrols an essential genre distinction that contributes to \nwhat makes SF (science, speculative, fiction, fantasy) distinctive (even \nif we accept that genre distinctions are not absolute). It isn’t accidental \nthat SF deals in and with singularity questions; this is consonant \nwith what makes it what it is.\nSecond, it is to be noted that public discourse around singularity \nis often as much about the magical and the irrational as it is about \nhard science or technology (conventionally defined). Here I want \n Those in love with quantum filth  193\nto briefly invoke research on SF and influence using digital humanities \ntools, undertaken with Georgina Voss and Ed Steinmueller (2013). \nThis involved following singularity memes on the internet, starting \nfrom their fictional ‘roots’ (e.g. websites of SF authors), through \npopular science, academic and private scientific communities, and \nsites promoting alternative belief systems of all kinds. The flow \nreached singularity organizations, linked the aroma-therapeutic to \nthe extropian, hooked up Wired to aliens, and reached through \nsingularity organization sites far into SF communities. What the \ntrails indicate, amongst other things, is that SF is an actant in singular-\nity discourse networks; its fictional claims condition how singularity \nissues are taken/taken up, contributing to the strength of the network \nas operational, and the qualities of its operation.5\nThe third leg needed to make the case for SF’s privileged rela -\ntionship to singularity concerns care. A peculiarity of singularity \ndiscourse is that key players and insiders declare the stakes to be \nthe highest possible (human existence is in the balance). More, their \nprognostications are reported in respectable places (the scientific \npress, for instance IEEE publications) and in mainstream media. \nStill, however, they are mostly not believed; or, rather, the gravity \nof their claims is not fully acknowledged or taken on board. Publics \nin general are not joining the game, committing to the values of the \nsingularity field, which is perhaps why the alarming pronouncements \nof those who are expert players in the relevant fields (Weizenbaum \nonce, now people like Bill Joy, Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking, and \nothers in AI-related fields) have little purchase, their messages regarded \nas alarmist or sensationalized or overly speculative. Whether these \ncalls are right or wrong is not the issue here. What matters is \nthat since we don’t really believe them, we don’t really care – and  \nvice versa.\nSF doesn’t have this problem. It doesn’t have to be ‘taken seriously’ \nto be taken seriously, or for the forms of life, of being, the possible \ncollective futures that it produces, to be cared about. What undermines \nserious discussion of singularity, what produces the paradoxically \nhyperbolic and bathetic discourse of carrots and upgrades, futures \nand skin care, serious science journals and sensationalism, brutal \ndismissal and over-eager hype, loose promises and big money – which \nis the matter of unbelief – doesn’t matter, isn’t relevant to, SF’s \nexplorations of singularity. SF, then, produces grounds in which it \n194 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nis possible to care about a possible future and the material forms \nthat life takes without having to believe in the science that supports \nthe journey towards its implementation, or its feasibility. Routing \naround the impossibility of caring about what we do not believe \nin, which produces an ambivalent public response to singularity, SF \ncan provide a place to care and ways to care about singularity \nfutures and about the post or meta or future human or non-human \nvariants it might support. As part of that it can provide ways to \nexplore new forms of being; whether these are then accounted for \nin critique by way of interpellation, via an account of cognitive \nestrangement of the novum, the attachments of narrative, or the \nsatisfactions of the game, is of less import – fictionality rather than \nform is key here. Distinctions between SF and ‘scientific’ accounts \nof singularity, then, centrally concern how claims to ontological \ntruth or fictional veracity or intensity are articulated.\nRecent work by both Donna Haraway and Bruno Latour explores \ncare and technological futures in relation to limits to growth and \nmatters of the Anthropocene (Latour, 2011, 2018, Haraway, 2016). \nHaraway has long drawn on SF’s capacity to reconfigure possible \nforms of future possibility in her critical science writing; her 1980s \ncyborg was a mythical being, and the late work, treading less lightly, \ndeploys theory-fiction in more straightforward narrative ways – albeit \nproblematically (see Haraway, 2016). The links I want to develop \nbetween (science/speculative) fictional figuration, technology and its \nlimits, and care build on both to some extent but also take a different \nform. Care can be too easily invoked as a term implying it is its \nown solution – only care. But the question is how? In work around \nthe unrepresentable (far futures, far catastrophe, far-flung humans, \nfar-out humans), care has to be invoked in a more demanding way, \nas what must be undertaken despite what cannot be felt, or expe-\nrienced, or fully comprehended. If care is a responsibility that may \nbe difficult to take on, partly because it cannot purely be a question \nof ‘knowing’ – an epistemic question – then how might SF, beyond \nsuch issues and debates as those that cohere around the epistemologi-\ncal gravity issue, enable forms of care?\nA response might be found by turning to explore the ‘greater \nrealism’ that Le Guin identified in SF work and said would be \nhelpful for future thinking – including, presumably, for thinking \nfuture forms of post or anti-human being – and was therefore sorely \n Those in love with quantum filth  195\nneeded. However, responsibility in relation to SF is certainly not \na matter of pedagogy (nor does it confine SF to what Benjamin \ntermed operational forms of writing). However, Le Guin’s comments \nfunction to expose a tension in SF, or perhaps an oscillation; SF \nmay be understood through its engagement with the dynamics of \nutopia – which entails an escape6 from the boundaries of the given, \nand a travelling on, a roving, but it may also be explored for its \nstaying power, its capacity to take seriously, stay with, pay fierce \nattention to, precisely to take care of the places it finds itself in, \nor the places and peoples it writes.7 To say that SF cares is not to \ndiscern a specific orientation, utopian or dystopian, left or right. \nIt is, rather, to suggest that care is something SF can do because \nof what it is; something which might be exploited, or pushed, or \nengaged with in various ways.\nWorking through this, I now consider how a series of SF works \nhave taken care with singularity and AI issues and how, in taking \ncare, they have taken sides. These are not technological dystopias, \nor are not read as such here. There is a long tradition of writing \nagainst machine intelligence, from Frankenstein on, and also in film, \nfrom the False Maria to Terminator, perhaps, that could be invoked. \nMy intention here is to exploit SF’s capacity to attend, to stay with, \nto explore more ambiguous formations. These enable an exploration \nof how an anti-computational impulse is tested in the flesh, how \nlanguage itself can be anti-computational, as well as, in an odd \nsense, always already post-human, and how questions arising around \nsingularity scale up. The works invoked here are striking for the \nways in which they treat and challenge that urgent/unreal matter \nat the heart of singularity, one that arises and arises again: human \nexistence versus the rise of machine intelligence. This is a matter \nwe are familiar with these days, although we hear it more as a \nroutine exhortation in relation to devices than in relation to ourselves \n– upgrade or replace?\nThe difference that makes a difference: bodies of glass  \nin the 1990s\nIn the early 1990s cyberspace generated and circulated a new genera-\ntion of upload fantasies. Hans Moravec notoriously proposed a robot \n196 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nbush as a viable new form of body, welcomed the AI singularity, \ncelebrated the end of the human, and looked forwards to the rise \nof his new overlords (Moravec, 1988). Singularity featured heavily \nin William Gibson’s early fictional worlds, and also figured within a \nthen extant popular imaginary which valorized or feared the coming \nvirtualization of life, but either way was fascinated by it. Of course, \ncyberspace was not ‘the internet’, and the terms were never simply \ninterchangeable; neither the avant-garde imaginaries of publications \nsuch as MUTE, lists such as Rhizome, nor the milieu of the Institute \nof Contemporary Art (ICA) nor the popular imaginary and/in its \ncommoditized forms (advertising for the computer industry would \nbe a good example), nor even digital cultural studies, were ever as \nthoroughly cyber-spatial as has since been suggested. Certainly not if \nthat meant they were gulled by its call to abandon Real Life for the \nvirtual space behind the screen. Nobody jumped in. However, there \nwas the internet itself, and the airy transactions it allowed, fuelling \nspeculation about new forms of being and enabling new ways of \nexploring it, even if in very partial ways. Further, there was cyberspace \nas William Gibson wrote it in Neuromancer (1984) and elsewhere. \nThis did include the admittedly ambiguous but nonetheless potent \nhymn to the virtual network, the new other place whose tangled \ncomplexity gave it a peculiar substantiality even in its refusal of \nsubstance. This was the consensual hallucination, the unthinkable \ncomplexity, the light space ranged in the mind, and it did provide \nthe beginnings of a way to think about how to live, and what \nnew life might be. Cyber and its new or refreshed suffixes – space, \ntime, bodies, punk – certainly came again to be emblematic of a \nparticular moment.\nGibson has since declared his indifference to issues of the \nsingularity, that possible or fantastic future event, believed in, \nderided, dispatched, revenant, hoped for as salvation, or feared as \nthe end of the human. Deliverance or death, or that event we may \nsimply find ourselves on the other side of one day and wonder \nwhat the fuss was all about. Nor did he ever choose between the \nflesh and the virtual life. However, a cyber preference was how the \ncultural imaginary read his 1990s works at the time – and with \nreason. It was ‘meat’ that the despairing hero of Neuromancer fell \nback into when he lost access to the network; ‘simstim’, which  \n Those in love with quantum filth  197\ninvolved the simulation of the flesh was rather despised; and there \nwas the bodiless, the specifically bodiless, exaltation of cyberspace, \nthose lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind (Gibson, \n1984). This sensibility was consolidated in more popular cultural \narenas, for instance via the later Matrix films. It chose the virtual, \nthe artificial, the mind over the body, which is viewed as, in the \nend, possible to step over, or set aside.\nMarge Piercy’s early 1990s novel Body of Glass/He, She and It \n(1993) was avowedly written8 as an interested response to cyberspace \nand the prospect of AI and new forms of life. It set out to rethink \nin feminist terms what Piercy viewed as the masculine attachments \nof cyberspace, some of the absolute divisions (on and offline) it \nappeared to cleave to, and some of its presumptions about technology \nand everyday life. Responding to cyberspace, Piercy was developing \na long-standing feminist engagement with technological societies, \nartificial life, and gendered possible futures. Her Woman on the \nEdge of Time, a paean for a woman of colour who makes a choice \nabout the shape of the future, despite the powerlessness of her \nposition in the time she finds herself in, is relevant here.9\nIn Body of Glass attention is paid to embodied intelligence, human \nand machinic, to how a person (artificial or not) comes to be, and \nto the texture of a precarious but possible domestic life. There is \nless of the alluringly dystopian darkness of Neuromancer, more \nenvironmental degradation, and less of the bittersweet aesthetic \nappreciation of the ‘television sky’ that is part of cyberspace imaginar-\nies. The network is there, but as now as a birthright for those with \nrights, become infrastructural, with all the unevenness of distribution \nand access that the term implies. The prospects for intelligent machines \nand artificially augmented humans emerge through an overlapping \nseries of connected narratives through which themes of perfection, \nmastery, slavery, and freedom, are developed. The protagonists include \na cyborg named Yod, the tenth in his series, a highly enhanced \nhuman woman, a partly sentient house invested in the species-purity \nof humans (and apparently troubled by the cyborg’s ‘improper’ \nrelationship with one of its inhabitants). There is also the golem \nJoseph, whose rise into life and fall back into clay in an embattled \nJewish community is recounted as a tale within a tale, distant from \nthe events of the main narrative, but recapitulating its central dilemma: \n198 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nhow may a life be lived, how can a being be, if that life is owned \nby another, its creator and father; if, by virtue of its constitution, \nits purpose is not its own?\nBody of Glass prefers some forms of life to others, which is to say \nthat some lives appear more viable, in multiple ways but particularly \nin relation to socio-economic arrangements (sovereignty, ownership). \nYod in the end sees viability in binary terms – augmented humanity \nversus artificial life – but the divisions the work articulates are more \ncomplex. First, then, there is the fact that Yod’s uncertain status \nconfounds any simple binary ontology: organic or artificial, human \nor machine. This alive but not-human being, who is neither he, \nnor she, nor feels himself to be an it, is self-consciously aware of \nhaving an uncertain claim to aliveness. Sex and gender intervenes, \nas it has done from Turing on to underscore the complexity of \nsuch questions as: ‘Is it alive?’ ‘Is life enough to be a person?’ \n‘Is intelligence enough?’ Yod passes the Turing test – now made \nflesh, made sex, made love. But the issue is not centrally about \nsimulation, a matter of passing, which is always in a sense a matter \nof trickery, nor even about ontology. Yod emerges and acts in the \nuniverse of the novel as a being both more than human and less. \nHis impervious skin lets him move freely in a polluted environment \nand his strength and ‘native’ capacity to operate in virtual worlds \nmake him a super-human fighter. He is faster, stronger, quicker at \ncalculating. Simultaneously though, his artificial body categorizes \nhim as less than a fully human being in relation to the common \nbody of the community which judges what kinds of bodies are \nlegitimate within it and are therefore given rights within it. Yod’s \nprogramming binds him to his father/master, who may command \nhim to destroy himself and to destroy others. This makes him, in \nhis own radiation-resistant, superhuman, but also introspective eyes, \neither a controllable machine or a living commodity; effectively a \nslave. He may choose to protect the community in which he lives, \nbut it may simply demand that protection as a consequence of the \nfact that he is owned. To pay him wages would be to undermine \nthe community’s (sense of) its right to make that demand, since it \nwould recognize him as a living being and therefore also as a citizen \n– and vice versa. But even if it wished to accord recognition, how \ncan an entity unable to make autonomous decisions, by reason of \nownership, being legally but also materially defined as the intellectual \n Those in love with quantum filth 199\nand physical property of another, be fully part of common decision \nmaking amongst a community of other beings, if that community \nclaims it is free, based on each within it having a voice of their \nown? Yod, then, is subject to the law of a father, and therefore has \nno legitimate social being. Questions of freedom, citizenship, rights, \nwhich might seem to be supplemental to, or come after, singularity \nitself, are revealed to be central; being part of singularity’s making, \nits materials, its conditions of possibility. Body of Glass  exposes \nways in which considerations of the viability (or preferability) of \nnew forms of intelligent life that arise cannot rest solely on ontol -\nogy (human brains, robot circuits, flesh or rubber), nor on the \nform or substance of a ‘life’ (mud, code, human flesh, for instance), \nalthough these are conditioners, but also on that nexus of relations \nthat constitutes a material political economy within which beings  \ncome to be.\nSingularity’s brusque compression of current life to that of the \n‘human’, to be either upgraded or replaced by the entirely non-human \nor non-organic, is countered here by the complex entanglements of \nthe tale, not least its exploration of (gendered) familial as well as \nsocial structures and their tensioned relationships. Moreover, the \nnarrative takes a different route to that classically taken by fictional \nrobots who feel the constraints of their chains – that of revolt, the \nrise of the machines. The lines are not to be so clearly drawn. Yod \nis well over half in love with (at least one member of) the human \nrace, and is perhaps because of that also half embracing death, that \nwhich was thought to be a human call, that which singularity wishes \nat all costs to delay/evade/overcome. Yod’s self-adumbration of \nhimself, in his own suicide note, is ‘I who may not be alive at all \n…’. In it he explicitly declares for augmented humanity over living \nrobots. In this fable, artificial life is made untenable, not because \nof its substance (machine not human flesh) but by the forms of \ncontrol that may be exercised over it through its commodity status. \nThis is a bare life at best, perhaps a half-life. It is, however, a life, \nand this is symbolized by its capacity to dissent. Unlike the golem \nof the ghetto in the tale within the tale who is laid down and unmade \nby his creators when his role is done, Yod does choose. He takes \nresponsibility for the unmaking of his species/series, binding it into \nhis own violent death. He declares against his own form of artificial \nlife and for augmented humanity.\n200 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nBody of Glass mirrors back the binary options common in singular-\nity discourse – augmented humans or artificial life – and in doing \nso refracts and diffuses them. It points to ways that in practice even \na fully artificial life might also, through training, socialization, and \neducation, have to become at least partly (post-)human, in order to \nbecome at all. Insisting that ‘lives’ are made through their conditioning \nand their struggles and are not simply either a matter of nativity or \ndecantation, Piercy’s work disrupts the peculiarly standardized \ninvocations of ‘the human’ in singularity discourse (which are often \nreflected in more mainstream arenas). Consider that what is to be \nimproved upon or perfected is adumbrated as baseline human (dif-\nference thus being laid aside), and also note that what it might mean \nto invoke perfection as a goal is rarely questioned, neither for what \nit might exclude nor for what it might make. Disability studies \nscholars, amongst others, have extensively explored the implications \nof perfected humanity as a demand in strong AI and have critiqued \nit in these terms (Brent, 2012). Within singularity discourse itself \ndivisions are evident between those who argue that transhumanism \nis based on a desire for the final perfection of the human, a ‘more \ncomplete victory over human limitations’ either through AI or \naugmentation, as Blackford has put it (Blackford, 2013: 424), and \nthose who want to think less in terms of outcomes and more in \nterms of processes10 whose endings may not be called in advance.\nPiercy, asking what might be good enough for form of life, or \nwhat form of life is good enough to be counted as life, is clearly \ninterested in the process and evolution of change, and Body of Glass \nleans towards forms of life that may develop in process, towards \nsubjects able to go with the grain of indeterminacy; the pursuit of \nperfection in the production of artificial life, notably the robot series \nof which Yod is a part, is configured as a dangerous and hubristic \nendeavour. Against this are the successful cyborg adaptations of others \nfiguring in the tale. This is very different from prioritizing a purely \nhuman mode of being, but, in the end, I’d argue that Piercy, like her \ncharacter, prefers the flesh and is, in this sense, anti-computational.\nIn Body of Glass  what it means to fall short of ‘being fully \nhuman’, or even having full life, is exposed as deriving from something \nmore complex than ‘how advanced’ a pass in the simulation game \ncan be achieved, or even how much (how perfect an) AI can be \ncultivated. Being fractures and responses to questions about life’s \n Those in love with quantum filth 201\nlimits, and of its possibilities to expand or grow, take new forms \nand shapes, or be made in new materials, become partly a matter \nof perspectives – ideological, normative, contestable. Piercy avoids \nthe cyberspace sublime, but mostly also the explicitly weird promise \nor threat of monsters. She deals, rather, in quasi counter-factual \nhistories of the future, exploiting a form of realism that resonates \nwith already existing human lives, scales, organizations; this is the \nthing that might be going to have happened but did not (yet). The \ntwist in the tail (the ‘greater realism’?) comes when it is realized \nthat the ‘factual’ countered in Body of Glass is the less-than-factual \ncyberspace and virtual life imaginary that dominated public internet \ndiscourse of the 1990s.\nWhat language may speak that code may not\nLet’s talk about monsters. The monstrous is anti-computational. It \nrefuses obvious rationality. Its affordances solicit not attempts to \ncompute but reactions that may include wonder or terror. The \nmonstrous does not offer solutions, but it might raise, make graspable, \nor embody real impossibilities. Moreover, even if the monstrous is \nanti-computational, its materials may include everything artificial. \nDrawing on tensions between flesh and machine, many such monsters \nhave crawled into the horizon of our own experiences; the False \nMaria Machine mensch of Metropolis in all her robotic femininity \nand artificial guile stands as an ur-figure for this, and also indicates \nits conventional gendering – something later cyber-feminists turned \naround, claiming a ground zero, an uncountable, a not-one.\nWhen the meta-human manifesto declares monsters are promising \nit aligns itself with visions of a form of post-human life predicated \non the dissolution or confusion of human boundaries through their \nadmixing with the computational which also refuses the closures, \nor the reductions, that this might imply. In the Manifesto (and other \nsimilar) theorizations, the monstrous stands as a figure for the coming \nforms of new life that its authors assume are arising by virtue of \ncomputational developments currently being systematically exploited. \nIt’s not only flesh monsters, then, but monstrous machines, and the \npromise of monster machines, orphans in two directions, as Haraway’s \nmanifesto (1991) almost put it, that matter.\n202 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nThe fantastic, as a literary form, partakes of this promise, indeed \nprefigures its theoretical uptake, and certainly produces monsters \n– from Lovecraft’s objectionable weirdness on. Fantasy finds room \nat least for the weird, the fantastical, and/or the monstrous, which \nmay be explored through creatures that are synthetic as well as \norganic, machinic as well as fleshy. Sparking off fantasy, and weird, \nbut also going beyond its narrower generic confines (themselves \ndisputed) is the New Weird. It too tends to refuse the abstractions \nand the closures characteristic of computationally based approaches \nto artificial life, at least where this stands alone or is valorized for \nits purity. The underpinnings of Weird as a genre (both considered \nin historical terms, where Lovelock is an inescapable figure, and in \nrelation to the formal characteristics of Weird writing which inhere \nin its style and its subject matter) are the unreasonable and the \nnon-comprehensible. Here be monsters, not rational creatures. Here \nbe beings in uncountable/unaccountable dimensions, whose reality \nnothing can capture; the uncanny and the singularly strange.\nThe Weird is already a revolt in the flesh and it is hostile to the \nconventional determinations of the technological/artificial. The New \nWeird, redefining this genre, constitutes another more or less conscious \nresponse to cyberspace as a dominant technological imaginary arising \naround the net, celebrating the disembodiment of the human soul, \nand foreshadowing the rise of new intelligence streams in/or as \npurely informational architectures. However, in contrast to Piercy’s \ncareful exploration of new forms of life, which relies on an internal \nconsistency, and on the feasibility of new bodies/new life forms’ \nactions, the new Weird operates in unreal modalities of body, flesh, \nbrain, engagement, interaction, recognition. In the case I want to \nexplore it also operates through language, in a story in which \nunknowable ‘monsters’ come to speak in new ways and in doing \nso celebrate the impossible modalities of human language.\nThe New Weird resonated with gathering disenchantment with \nthe radical potential of the old net, and the model of disembodiment \nit offered, found on the left. Frederic Jameson once differentiated \nfantasy from SF by dividing bodies from machines and declaring \nthe former to be technically reactionary; interesting exceptions, cases \nwhere the scent of history could be nosed out even in the fantastical, \nonly confirmed this rule, he argued (Jameson, 2005: 60). Contra to \nthis, by the 1990s cyberpunk was often reactionary because technicist, \n Those in love with quantum filth  203\ncapable of storing the neoliberal visions of technological futures \nand transformations that drive the market, but not able to configure \nother more radical forms of future desire, nor to deal with how \nthese might be organized, developed, and exploited. The New Weird \nsets the monstrous against the application of computational exactitude \nand its extensions into probabilistic prediction based on big data \nas a marketing or behavioural tool. In this way it can be read as a \ncritical response to the enclosing grid and abstractions of the virtual \nturn.\nOn the other hand, it wasn’t then (and certainly isn’t now) only \nthose with a critical view who were dissatisfied with the inadequa -\ncies of an informational vision divorced from embodiment and its \nimpurities. Silicon Valley’s corporations have long sought to capture \nthe previously unquantifiable and elusive, the impure as well as the \ndeterminate, the material as well as the abstract forms of social life, \nof life itself. A shift in focus towards the inexactitude of the flesh \nenables critique but also responds to, and relates to, a more general \nshift in computational developments and industry goals, from digital \nto bio-digital as the centre of attention,11 from the capture of the \neasily quantifiable in zones already virtual, to the hunt for ways \nto undertake the deep capture operations necessary to enable the \nextension of the commodification of the social world that pervasive \nmediation, big data, and machine learning undertake. The New \nWeird’s fascination with the impurity of hybrid bodies, with the \nincomputable, in this way joins with, is part of, a more general turn.\nBut this is still too tidy. China Miéville, a notable Weird practitioner \nand also a left theorist, interviewed in 2011, argued that the New \nWeird spoke to the (then) contemporary because it could speak to \nthat obscurity in relations, that mystification, that is at the heart of \nthe market: its fetishism. In particular, it responds to that mystification \nthat is promulgated through the various promises of the computa-\ntional, made in discourse and expressed in its operations, so that \nthe real issue is computational capitalism (McDonald, 2011). \nMiéville’s claim, therefore, which again relates directly to Le Guin’s \nsense of SF’s capacity for greater realism, is that the fantastic mode \ncan engage with lived reality of modernity in ways that realist fiction \ncurrently can’t. It is a ‘default cultural vernacular’ (Miéville, 2002) \nbecause it resonates with what is also a fantasy, the fantasy of real \nlife under capital, the fantasy that is at the heart of our material \n204 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nworld and its emerging technologies. The fantastic, as a literary \nform, and in particular the New Weird, can (potentially) get at what \nis itself a fantastical colonization, and deal with it better than \nconventional forms of literary realism, because it can better get at \n‘things’ beyond natural realism, or empirical realism. Unlike the \npostdigital, it continues to give technological inauguration and change \nits full (over-full, impossible, monstrous) attention. Unlike object-\norientated forms of new materialism, which have flirted with the \nWeird (see e.g. Harman, 2010), attracted by its attention to the \npresence of things, however, Miéville accepts the constitutive and \nperformative force of the entanglement between the symbolic and \nthe real; that indeed is how he builds his monsters.\nJameson explored Miéville’s work in relation to Perdido Street \nStation (2000), but the focus here is on Embassytown (2011), which \nturns on a war in language, in which language itself, in its materiality \nand as it symbolizes, is a particular kind of weapon. Embassytown \ncelebrates the incomputable excess that defines (human) poetic \nlanguage, and it works through ways in which forms of language \nand forms of embodied life – whether these are human, alien, post-\nhuman, artificial – are bound up with each other.\nThere are three languages and three kinds of being in Embassytown, \na human bubble on an alien world. The humans have a polysemic \nlanguage that refers beyond what it names. The Ariekei have a \nlanguage that names what is directly and cannot say what is not \n(perhaps therefore they are enslaved in language, or perhaps they \nare free of alienation, this is never entirely clear). Then, appearing \nless often, there is the speech of an artificial being, an automaton \nwhose output sounds human but is also always encoded. Neither \nof these last two languages may truly inaugurate. One has soul12 in \nit, but no capacity to make new worlds, whilst the other enables \ncommunication in the formal sense, but does not – perhaps – host \nlife. In contrast, seductive enough to start a world war is human \nlanguage, exemplified by metaphor, defined in Embassytown as the \ncapacity to make new, to say what is not, or what was not before \nit was said. The philosopher Paul Ricoeur13 has considered metaphor’s \nlinks to what is (able) to be, arguing that metaphor forces together \ntwo terms, and does so around the verb ‘to be’ (this is this – even \nwhen it is not). It might thus be said to have a kind of ‘ontological \nvehemence’ (Ricoeur, 2003, Martinengo, 2010). Metaphor is a lie \n Those in love with quantum filth  205\nthat makes what is made through the impossible couplings it produces \nreal; the City is a Heart, insists the protagonist of Embassytown \nAvice Benner Cho (ABC), and the ‘heartish city’ is thus made. The \nAriekei want to lie. At Bakhtinian-style festivals dedicated to this, \nthe lie which they may not speak is approached via the ecstatic, the \nglossolaliac, the trance, the glitch, the stutter, the break; a kind of \nlinguistic practice that is, if not anti-computational, then resistant \nto its operations, alien to its closures, an efflorescence, a making, \na cheating, a simulating that seeks to cheat its way into the real.\nAvice, who speaks of metaphor, as a child became a living simile \nfor her alien hosts. She is ‘the girl who …’. She has enacted what \nthey may not otherwise grasp, since in their language they may \nnot say what is not. But the enactment undermines itself. Being a \nsimile, Avice is traducing simile’s claims to only being like. She is \nthe girl who … The distinction between simile as simulation (like) \nand metaphor as being (is) is both absolute and thus continuously \nundermined.\nImitation (being like) and simulation reintroduces the third kind \nof being, and the third kind of language found in Embassytown. \nAlongside the alien hosts and the squabbling humans are machines, \nincluding the automaton Ershul, who ‘wasn’t human, but was almost’. \nThe personhood of Ershul is initially defended by Avice through an \nappeal to the category of friendship, with its non-fungible demand \n– ‘spending time with most automa is like accompanying someone \nbrutally cognitively damaged, but Ershul was a friend’ (Miéville, \n2011: 43). As the Ariekei fall into the delirium of language Ershul \nbecomes increasingly silent. She loses her place in the story, becomes \n‘a character without a plot’,14 an enigma, an absence, some(thing) \nalready gone. Her liveness itself appears compromised, her two-\ndimensionality comes to matter – ‘her avatar face froze, flickered \nand came back on’ (Miéville, 2011: 115). She seems unable to speak \nof certain things. Ershul becomes a blank or reflecting screen, a \ntelevision surface. Avice, the alphabetical human, is left wondering \nif what appeared to be friendship was in the end simply an optimized \ninterface, friendship’s communicative affordances affording maximum \nefficiency for the data-collecting habits of a machine (Miéville, 2011: \n188),15 but amounting in the end only to the simulation of a par -\nticularized form of interest; logical enough if the simulator was \nnever more than the simulacrum of a person. Exploring code and \n206 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nlanguage, N. Katherine Hayles invokes Kittler, who argues that the \n‘dilemma between code and language’ produces an irresolvable \nconflict. This means, he says, that ‘the program will suddenly run \nproperly when the programmer’s head is empty of words’ (Kittler, \n2008: 46). In Embassytown this is inverted. When the humans make \nfriends with the alien hosts, when the vitality of human words \nbecomes an infection, it is the program named Ershul that stops \nrunning. When language came, the AI did not speak.\nIn Embassytown symbolic language with its informing vitality \nand with the capacity to inaugurate that arises through polysemy \nis monstrous and excessive. It lets in a new form of life; the city is \nto be remade, and if the shared language it will speak was originally \nhuman the materials of the city are thoroughly alien. The war in \nlanguage in Embassytown thus produces something that might aptly \nbe explored as a new collective social body, one which is not entirely \nhuman. This might be considered as a form of meta-humanism, \nperhaps, but it gestures towards something different from the version \nelaborated in Ferrando’s account, not least because, whilst post-human \nanatomically – since in Embassytown symbolic language relies on \nlife itself but not exclusively on any innate human-shaped capacity, \ncognitive or otherwise, to speak – it remains fleshy and attached to \norganic being. It comes into being by excluding the only artificial \nbeing present. So it is through and in language as it is fleshed and \nvoiced that questions of simulation, simulated life, and (language \nand) recognition are argued out here. And it is the language of \nmetaphor that is furthest from the restrictions of code that speaks \nagainst the computational, offering in the place of code which reduces \nand places and accurately describes, a language that works by lying, \nexceeding, by falling short, and over-reaching. Language here becomes \nrevolutionary.\nThe New Weird with its monsters, and its monstrousness, and \nits delight in impossible excess, certainly replies to the faded and \ntattered imaginary of virtuality, and in doing so can question a \nparticular form of modernist rationality. I want to stress finally, \nhere, that there is weird, and weird, and weird. Miéville’s Weird is \nat odds with the kind of weirdness loved by the OOO new material-\nists, particularly as this was hitched to the new aesthetic with its \ninvitation to luxuriate in the strange objects around us, to listen for \n Those in love with quantum filth 207\nthe pixels to hum, and to forms of media materialism which repudiate \nmeaning. By contrast, Miéville’s is a weird in which meaning and \nmediation are key, and in which humans are always to be implicated \nin their environments, part of the promise and part of the threat. \nThis form of Weird contains a contestation for the present. If Piercy’s \n1990s counter-factual realism undermines or challenges the allure \nof the computational excess, the artificial as fetishized in cyberspace, \nMiéville’s Weird, as it took shape in the early 2000s, celebrated the \ndense infolding of the flesh and, continuous with that ,celebrates \nlanguage and its generative capacity. Embassytown at least prefers \nthe excess of signification to the determination of code, and in this \nway prefers particular forms of (new) life over others that are entirely \nmechanical.\nQuantum filth, merged minds, residual humans …\nFinally I turn to the Fractal cycle of H.R. Rajaniemi, a Finnish \nmathematician who writes in English. The Quantum Thief , the \nFractal Prince, and the Causal Angel (published between 2010 and \n2014) explore the stakes of singularity and the transhuman across \nthe grounds of a baroque universe over-stuffed with multiple forms \nof human and post-human life and after-life. The gravity of terrestrial \nworlds is mostly set aside in favour of exploring a post-singularity \nSpace-opera universe characterized by the generalized extension of \nthe debt relation to include the literal accumulation of life itself in \na universe of multiple intelligence streams.\nIn the Fractal novels contestation is not over language but, rather, \nfollows the logics of serious gaming; Huizinga peeks in, rather than \nRicoeur. A series of warring parties, each adopting their own form \nof post-human life, strive against each other, or occasionally cooperate, \nto survive, thrive, dominate, or overcome. This is a game played in \nthe aftermath of singularity. The protagonists include a gaming \nsociety, the Zoku, committed to matter and championing a form of \nentangled existence formally allowing individual consciousness, but \nalso operating through shared and increasingly potent volitional \n‘nudges’ modulating individual desires. Against them stand the \nendlessly acquisitive Sobornost, giant collective brains directed by \n208 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nPrimes or the Gods in the clouds and supported by myriad hierarchi-\ncally (genealogically) organized clones and billions of collected and \nuploaded Gogol souls. This is the meat hate side and it appears to \nbe winning.\nBetween these major players are the exhausted remnants of once \nmore or less baseline human beings, who still adhere to forms of \nembodied and individual life, albeit in forms highly technologized \nand augmented and involving compromises with the quantum. \nThese include the Aun, hanging on to old Earth, now a desert \ncorrupted with wild code where couplings with other intelligences \ncan maintain a form of human life, and the Oort, ice carvers \nwho embrace the Dark Man of the vacuum in spaceship saunas \n(the Oort are thinly disguised Finns) or joining the uploaded. \nFinally, there is society of the Oubliette, where life is lived on \ntwo watches and the fully living count down their life credit and \namass more through long work as a Quiet. In the Oubliette, to be \nfully oneself, flesh meeting the memory, a social (time) debt must  \nbe paid.\nBut this is more than a fairy story turned Space opera; a political \nformation and a form of post-humanity are here tightly enmeshed. \nSingularity, and its economy, the debts it produces when bodies and \nminds become tradable commodities (or futures), is both enacted \non bodies (or negates them entirely) and becomes a system. Debt \nis at the heart of social relations in the Fractal universe, and debt \nrelations organize the story arcs of many protagonists. The whole \ncan be read as an inquiry, a series of thought experiments, into how \nrelations of debt scale up, and scale out, how they translate into \ndimensions and societies far beyond those lived by humans in ter -\nrestrial societies, where domination and the forms it may take are \nremapped. Debt here, defined as a key relationship in computational \ncapitalism, and already relating to biopower, here links very tightly \nto the capture of, and quantification of, being. This is singularity \nas a commodity relation.\nCentral here are the Sobornost, for whom the entanglements of \nthe physical world are corrupt and unclean. Their war is against \nmatter, their endless desire is to salvage consciousness. All that was \nhuman shall become ‘gogol’ – and of course it was Gogol who \nwrote a story about the sale of dead souls, a pyramid/Ponzi scheme \ndealing in never-to-be-delivered futures. Salvage is commercial. For \n Those in love with quantum filth  209\nthe Sobornost, the ‘great common task’ of uploading and collecting \nintelligence constitutes a form of primitive accumulation, one in \nwhich a certain kind of immortality is given in exchange for the \nend of autonomy, individuality, and free will – which is to say the \nend of the self. Wikipedia tells us that the original Sobornost, a \nRussian movement that lauded the ‘spiritual community of many \njointly living people’ prioritizing the whole over any form of indi-\nviduality, was defined as a moment of change. In the universe of \nthe Fractal Prince the rise of the Sobornost constitutes that moment, \nsignalling the establishment of a new form of life, the end of embodied \nand individual existence as default, and the expansion of a mode \nof primitive accumulation to produce ownership – or an indebted \nrelation – without end.\nWork exploring debt and its relation to capitalism has proliferated. \nDavid Graeber’s (2014) work explores its history. In work exploring \n(Foucault’s) consideration of the relationship between war and \ngovernance as strategies of domination, Lazzarato follows some of \nthe same lines but specifically explores war and debt. Lazzarato \nunderstands debt/credit to operate both ‘as a dispositif’ or form of \ngovernance and ‘as war, that is to say, as a strategic confrontation \nground’ (Lazzarato, 2011: 3). His position is that ‘telluric forces’ \nof ‘deterritorialization’, or accumulation by dispossession, are now \ncontinuous. In The Making of the Indebted Man he argues that as \na consequence everybody owes (Lazzarato, 2011: 1). This also means \neverybody is owned, or rather that the vast majority of the population \nare indebted to, or owned by, the very few who are the creditors. \nMoreover, they are owned into the future, which is to say their \nfuture is owned or foreclosed, because they are in debt for their \ntime to come (Lazzarato, 2011: 32).\nIn the Fractal universe, credit, debt, indebtedness, and foreclosure \noperate at huge scales. A new feature, however, is that debt tends \nto become permanent, singularity terminating that which might \nhave wiped the debt clean (at least for the debtor) by confounding \ndeath itself. Through uploading, indebted being becomes a quasi-\nontological state (perhaps as well as a legal or heritable one). \nSubordinate clones are always indebted to their makers; this is an \nindebtedness without reason, not acquired through inheritance. The \ncost of uploaded immortality, dividing consciousness and perishable \nflesh, is the condition of indebtedness going forwards.\n210 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nLazzarato’s argument is that in the end war is not over territory \nbut population, and if war turns back into a matter of governmentality \nit is still population that remains the key. Chiming with that, what \nis at issue in the Fractal universe and the wars it explores is the \nmatter of the population; its consciousness (to be subsumed), its \nbody (to be disposed of), its very life, which is to be accumulated, \nor brought into the creditor/debtor relation.\nThe great common task of the Sobornost is to abstract intelligence \nfrom its chiasmic grounds in embodied life, as a strategy of domina-\ntion. The projected/desired fulfilment of this process is, perhaps, the \nend of war, and the institution of a new form of absolute governance \n– so absolute as to absorb entirely the minds of planetary populations. \nThe end, then, is not discipline (or love, as it was in 1984), nor \neven control, which needs after all to be exercised, but terminal \nrecruitment and collection.\nIn this universe individual players can only try to tilt a board in \nwhich massive power is in the hands of the controlling brains powered \nby their billions of uploads with the cognitive capacities to burn \nout stars and build them. They include a thief, a goddess (a splinter \nfrom a prime), a ship, an ice warrior, an amnesiac child god, and \na living ship.16 They too are entangled in debt relations. The lead \nis Jean Le Flambeur, a thief much reduced from an earlier more \naugmented state, personally in debt to the people who spring him \nfrom a prison, running endless and endlessly violent iterations of \nprisoner’s dilemma games, who subverts creditor/debtor relations \nto get what he certainly has not the credit to get. Le Flambeur’s \nmachinations are directed not against the particular life forms he \nencounters but against the disciplinary and regulatory regimes these \nforms make it possible to impose. This is singularity as political \nthrill and political thriller.\nLe Flambeur exploits the constantly reversing plane of govern -\nmentality and war, moving between the scales of conflict and of \ngovernance and messing with their relation. He is the cheating player \non a game board set out by forces far larger than him, he raises the \ntactical to the level of the planetary scale. Against the harvesters, \nfinding new moves, or undermining given instructions, he represents \nthe puny, but insistent and tricky, finding strength in matter and its \ncomplexities, in its irreducible quiddity, in the unique rather than \nthe cloned. Quantum filth against the Primes and their billions of \n Those in love with quantum filth  211\nclones, and their consciousness banks, and the rest. In the Fractal \nfuture at least, in the end, hope is (post-)human.\nThe novels evidence a contempt for the cold fusion of absolutes \nthat is represented by the terminal uploading of human minds, \nundertaken to build cognitive power and establish an empire. 17 \nContinually preferring the continued entanglement of matter and \nintelligent matter against untethered minds, they disturb any presump-\ntion that a cosmically expanded consciousness, or even a hugely \naugmented mind, naturally constitutes progress. On the other hand, \nthe Fractal universe is often joyous. What is rejected is not change \nor human evolution or new forms of intelligence. Rather, what is \nmocked is a mode of accumulation producing forms of life capable \nonly of parodic repetition; the absurdity, the hubris, of endless life \nand endless self, endlessly reproduced, of attempts to exist everywhere \nand for all time and in a million places at once; absolutely abundant, \nabsolutely the same, and always unfree.\nWhat remains is an affirmation of the non-computable self, still \nable to surprise, to engage in the exploit, and an affirmation of the \nway in which this more or less human self has also drawn closer \nto and is becoming entangled with other forms of being. Le Flambeur \nand a Goddess who loves him share a form of laughter, a kind of \nfatalism that frees both to act, that isn’t quite human, but isn’t \nentirely inhuman either. In the Fractal Prince series there is always \na beautifully ordered archive, a prison for minds and bodies whose \nbarbed wire is secured far into the past and future; this is the shape \nthe debt economy takes in a world where the currency is self and \nmind. If there is hope, it is because this form of currency may carry \nan excess charge, something not quite calculable in advance, and \ntherefore not quite fully integrated into the post-human, universe-wide, \ndebt economy, going forwards. To hope for a door is partly to create \nthe possibility that one might exist in a future that is, by virtue of \nthat hope, not entirely owned.\nConclusion\nThe works explored here span over three decades. They indicate an \nentanglement between singularity discourse and internet and new \nmedia technologies and (increasingly) between singularity and \n212 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nbiotechnological cultures. Each is media-archaeologically significant, \npartly because each complicates or dissents from key narratives \ncirculating around the time of their production. Together they \nundercut the temporality of the discourse of real singularity with \nits varied, but strikingly concrete, predictions of coming change. \nThey do this by exploiting the multi-directionality/dimensionality \nof SF which is both here now and unreal, not only to question what \nsingularity might possibly deliver, but to question the terms, the \npolitical economy, of that possible delivery.\nThey have in common that they exhibit a preference for a continued \nengagement with matter, and a desire to remain or retain something \nhuman. They value matter and/in its relation to consciousness. More \nthan that, they value matter, and human matter, because of its quiddity \nand resistance to terminal reconciliation. They were chosen to do \nthis, of course; selecting them, I was perhaps treasure hunting, \nsomething I have deplored elsewhere. My excuse is that I did it to \ncounter another other form of treasure hunting: that which seeks \nin SF an endless form of affirmation for the fictional future we are \ngiven as real by contemporary technological society, a system that \n‘liberates’ certain fictions ‘to rule over the social’, as Mark Fisher \nput it (see Fisher, 2009: xii), but refuses others as pure fantasy; and \nthat does this in relation to technology ruthlessly and relentlessly. \nLike Le Guin, I think SF can develop a much-needed critical and \nrealist engagement with what is given to us as the reality of the \nbio-computational future. This is why, as Mark Fisher noted, it may \nnot only simulate, elsewhere, but also come (back) (here) to act \nnow (Fisher, 2009: xiv).\nNotes\n1 ‘I have had a long career and a good one … The name of our \nbeautiful reward is not profit … it is freedom’ (Le Guin, http://blog.  \nworldswithoutend.com/2012/12/gmrc-review-always-coming-home-  \nby-ursula-k-le-guin/).\n2 Ferrando argues for a philosophical, cultural, and critical post-humanism,  \nin her case inflected by Heidegger and versions of appearance (Ferrando, \n2013: 27).\n3 A key thinker here is Braidotti.\n Those in love with quantum filth  213\n4 Suvin (1979) refers to the importance to SF of epistemological gravity \narising through the cognition effect and the Novum (the creation of \nworlds, and that which produces estrangement).\n5 See Bassett, Steinmueller and V oss (2013). Work commissioned for \nNESTA explored the relation between SF and ‘real innovation’. Our \nmethodology was informed by Franco Moretti and moved between \nhermeneutic and computational analysis.\n6 Oscar Wilde (2001) famously said of utopia, ‘when humanity lands \nthere, it looks out, and, seeing a better country, sets sail’.\n7 This kind of caring being at its most careful light years away from the \ndogmatic commitment of overtly pedagogical writing.\n8 Piercy invokes Gibson and cyberspace in her acknowledgements in \nBody of Glass (Piercy, 1993: 583).\n9 Women on the Edge of Time  (1976) was striking for its engagement \nwith a feminist utopian society in tune with its environment but under \nthreat, and barely sketched the outlines of its dystopian other – a highly \ntechno-celebrant society, the horrors of which are only glimpsed.\n10 See, e.g. Blackford who is in favour of a ‘more complete victory  \nover human limitations’ versus Martha Nussbaum’s sense that a  \n‘more than human life would not be a good life’ (Blackford, 2013: \n424–425).\n11 The rising market for biotechnological consumer products is one indicator  \nof this trend, amongst other things.\n12 An impossible, incomprehensible language. When the Ariekei speak, \nsays a linguist in Embassytown, ‘the words have got soul in them’ \n(Mieville, 2011: 56).\n13 A ‘Paul Ricoeur’ is named in Embassytown, one of the philosophers \nwhose linguistic theory might help explain the alien language. If the \ninvocation of a real philosopher constitutes a metafictional appeal to \nplausibility of the linguistic possibilities explored, then it might be \njustified to argue that it is linguistics rather than physics that provides \na form of epistemological gravity for this novel.\n14 As an internet fan noted.\n15 ‘I’d been to her home. T asteful accoutrements, perhaps for mine and \nothers’ benefits: elements of an operating system, designed to make her \nuser-friendly. These ruminations felt disgraceful’ (Mieville, 2011: 103).\n16 A living ship, and then a missing ship named Perhonen, which is the \nFinnish word for a butterfly.\n17 If these works are exploring the contest against a rising empire where \nthe odds are stacked in the empire’s favour, perhaps this shouldn’t \nbe a surprise. This is, amongst other things, a Finn writing about a \nRussian-named project of absorption, invasion, and empire.\n214 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nBibliography\nBassett, Caroline. 2012. ‘Why after Language Came the AI did not speak’. \nPaper to Weird Council: An International Conference on the Writing of \nChina Miéville, September, Birkbeck, London.\nBassett, Caroline, Ed Steinmueller and George Voss. 2013.

Jens Schanze (director).\nConclusion\nUpping the anti: a distant reading of the \ncontemporary moment\nIn the 2020s we live in an era of automation anxiety and automation \nfever (Bassett and Roberts, 2020). There are rising concerns around \nextant computational cultures, near-horizon developments, and \nlonger-term predictions about computational futures. Anti-computing \nof various kinds is back with a vengeance. A new moment of urgency \narises. Once again the contemporary moment is proclaimed as the \ntime of make or break, the time for decisive action. Once again it \nis argued that technology will in short order crystallize into a good \nor bad angel, working for good or ill, as Norbert Wiener put it, \nback in the 1950s – and his work too has undergone a revival. For \na flavour of the moment look at what the books say; Democracy \nHacked (Moore, 2018), for instance, claims we’re in the last chance \nsaloon, ‘if we don’t change the system now, we may not get another \nchance’, whilst People versus Tech (Bartlett, 2018) fears that unless \n‘we radically alter our course, democracy will join feudalism, supreme \nmonarchies and communism as just another political experiment \nthat quietly disappeared’. Others’ fears are more existential, reading \nthe contemporary moment as an AI tipping point.\nReading, or, rather, the matter of what is being read, is germane \nhere. This chapter is informed by sixty-four books that are critical, \nanxious, hostile, concerned, that are actively writing against the \ncomputational state we find ourselves in. But this is not a close \nreading. All the titles were located through Amazon, the majority \nwritten within the past five years, but all found in 2020. The contents \nof some of these inform the arguments here, but the chief interest \nis in a meta-narrative: how automation anxiety is being framed and \nsold, how those tropes identified as characteristic of various categories \nof automation anxiety are expressed, and how they recombine – or \n218 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\ndivide – in new ways today. Amazon’s algorithms thus assisted in \na somewhat unofficial form of distant reading (Moretti, 2013). The \nmethod – barely one – was simple. I swiped (left and right) across \nAmazon’s quasi-Borgesian ‘shelves’, letting it tell me what other \nreaders read (or bought) when they started where I started, with \nthe books I started with. I also explored Amazon’s ‘promoted’ reading \nsuggestions, which often threw up titles further from my concerns \nthan the reader recommendations.\nThree or four ‘seed’ books produced the vast majority of the \ntitles. A few emerged on later searches when I used new terms to \nroute around disconnects; cybersurveillance and detox, for instance, \ndidn’t quite intersect in expected ways. I make no claims to complete-\nness in undertaking this exercise – nor to having isolated a discrete \ngenre; these are not all anti-computing books, the boundaries of \nwhat constitutes a hostile or investigative account are disputable \nand sometimes blurred, and I certainly have no access to Amazon’s \nalgorithms, which occasionally threw up an entirely unexpected \nsuggestion. However, as a probe, this did produce results that were \nstartling, and not least in their quantity. Overall, the search evidenced \nan explosion of anti-computing taking many forms and evident \nacross a series of genres – I avoided a sharp division made repeatedly, \nfor instance in Paul Mason’s Clear Bright Future, between ‘airport’ \naccounts and ‘serious’ endeavours. This was a cornucopia of inter-\npretation, apostasy, outrage, sorrow, critique, and anger – along \nwith robust demands that readers suffering from computational \ncultures buy this book, or that one, to help themselves, or perhaps \nbe cured. (Emma Harrison’s extant and forthcoming work on con-\nnections between mental health and cultures of digital anxiety is \ngermane here.)\nThe probe thus indicated in outline the rough shape of contem -\nporary anti-computing formations, suggesting key foci, structures \nof feeling, emotional registers, the orientation and/or bias of currently \nloudly heard arguments. To consider these formations in relation \nto the taxonomic categories developed at start of this book is to \nask how or if they fit. They may also indicate how a category has \nmorphed, how connection with older or longer-standing formations \nis made, what of them is really new, and what persists or is revived \nfrom earlier moments, or revenant discourses. This is undertaken \n Conclusion 219\nin this chapter. It leads to a brief reassessment of anti-computing \nitself, offered by way of a conclusion to the book as a whole. The \nemphasis is on reconsidering the relationship between computational \nthinking as a cultural form encapsulating both fatalism about, and \na desire for, the further rise of the computational, and the anti-\ncomputational impulse, also fatalistic at times, but at others making \ndemands for change. I conclude finally that a certain kind of anti-\ncomputational thinking is necessary for truly hopeful computational \nfutures to be envisaged, sought – or fought for.\nDistant reading swallows Amazon\nI am looking for books attacking Amazon on Amazon. The platform \nobliges with The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, \nFacebook and Google by Scott Galloway (2017). Amazon is of \ncourse largely indifferent to the specifics of content. It doesn’t care \nwhat the books it sells communicate, it’s more interested in what I \ncommunicate to its algorithms in my fevered search for hostility to, \namongst other things, the platform upon which I conduct my searches. \nThe need to capture that data might produce a desire for a better \nsemantic understanding but there is no need for Amazon’s bots to \nappreciate irony, at least if the latter is measured in human terms, \nonly perhaps to understand that it is there.\nAmazon of course began with printed books – and perhaps it is \nsurprising that it still sells them. The book refused to die. You knew \nthis, I’m pointing to it because there’s a confluence to be observed; \nhere are objects which could be purely informational, that are, by \nour own desires, still (sometimes) produced on paper, with cardboard \ncovers, using CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) inks to absorb \nor reflect colour rather than relying on RGB (red, green, blue) screen \ndisplay technologies. Reading paper-based books itself begins to \nrepresent a slightly tenacious refusal to upgrade, or to be ‘up to \ndate’, and Amazon’s book pages, suggesting Kindle but just as willing \nto sell paper, both escalate the omnivorous logics of the digital and \npoint to a long-term, non-trivial, intrinsic, attachment to other kinds \nof material; to a form of resistance. They also point to the impurity \nof ‘the virtual’ as an offering in a material world, since even if books \n220 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nfinally become fully digital objects there will still be bodies to read \nthem, and this side of authoring developments signalled by OpenAI’s \nGPT2/3 language models at any rate, (post-)human authors to write \nthem. So, although not surprising, there is something nice about \nAmazon recommending (or passing on ‘reader’ recommendations, \nhowever these are manipulated through encoding) books that are \nhostile to its materials, to itself, to its logics; books that offer ways \nto break an addiction to the forms of networked sociality and com-\nmunication that it itself promotes and lives by. Printed books are \nfar less insistent that readers do not close the covers of a discrete \nwork without thinking about the next one ‘before you go …’. In \nall, then, what better place to stick around in, if we are looking for \nwhere anti-computing has got to by the turning of the first two \ndecades of the 21st century; right now – print publishing turnaround \ntimes – and my own tardy writing – permitting.\nWhat is this now? Or, rather, when is it? These are the days of \npolitics dominated by Trump’s tweets and Russian interference, Brexit \npopulism, fake news, rising acknowledgement of platform monopoly. \nWe live beyond the knowledge that the Cambridge Analytica scandal \ngave us, in an era of systematic bucket data capture, concern around \nscreen addiction, trolling, bias, misogyny, addiction, and the rest. \nMark Zuckerberg has declared the need for privacy and a desire to \nstep his platform away from the political writ large; a move back \nto the drawing room, as if that would chase out ‘the political’ (it’s \nalways already personal, a chorus of feminists point out). In the \nUK at least, there is a sense of political crisis, and a moral panic \nabout the internet as partly ‘what did it’ – but also a sense that \ndisengagement is not possible, particularly in COVID/Zoom times).\nThe above of course is a grossly compacted scenario. I invoke it \nto stress the force with which the sentiment that we live in unusual \ntimes (of political crisis, environmental crisis, moral crisis) is being \nfelt. Which is why it is useful – even salutary – to consider how \ncontemporary computational hostility, arising in response to that \nformation, part of it as well as mapping onto it, challenges and \npartially reshapes the more general taxonomy I began with, but \nalso works through its invocation.  Today’s anti-computing is a \nrecurrent, partly familiar affair, as well as something new. Many of \nthe tropes that inform it are ready to hand, some in more or less \ncomplete form, others it is itself reshaping.\n Conclusion 221\nNotes from an annotated meta-bibliography\nThe general taxonomy of anti-computing developed at the start of \nthis book (Figure 3 and Chapter 1) was generated both by paying \nattention to real-world formations across time and by working with \ncritical theorizations of the media-technological and of medium-\ntechnological cultures. A binary division between ontological and \npolitical justifications for anti-computational thinking was identified \nas informing popular thinking, but also as failing to hold, despite \nits ideological force. It was also recognized as inadequate as a way \nof grappling with, or categorizing, these formations in order to \ncritically investigate forms of anti-computing. A more elaborated \ntaxonomy of anti-computing was developed which avoided this \ndivision. Eight different forms which anti-computing has typically \ntaken were categorized and potentials for cross-cutting them with \nother classificatory systems (e.g. affective categories, critical theoretical \ndivisions) were explored.\nWhat is offered now is a partly automated reader’s report that \nresponds to these categories. As already noted it works with over \nsixty books which Amazon thinks somebody with an initial interest \nin something anti-computational should read because other readers \ndid. Following this trail, invoking titles, brief descriptions, and reader \ncomments offered, I explore how these works variously fit into, \nburst out of, modify, or challenge entirely the original anti-computing \ncategories, which together identified an anti-computational reservoir, \na persistent set of tropes, submerged but also ready to re-arise.\nFigure 3 A general taxonomy of anti-computing.\ni. Computer technology as control technology\nii. Computers becoming more lively \niii. Computerization and the hollowing-out of everyday life and \nsocial interaction\niv. Computer technologies and the threat to human culture\nv. The general accident/catastrophe theory\nvi. Horrible humans\nvii. Standardization/quantiﬁcation \nviii. Too much information\n222 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\n(i) Computer technology as control technology\nContemporary examples that fit squarely into this category are \nJonathan Taplin’s Move Fast and Break Things (2017), and Jamie \nBartlett’s The People versus Tech (2018). Both make the case for \nthe erosion of democracy by the tech corporations and their products \n– and both point to the consolidation of power in the new digital \neconomy’s heartland. Bartlett’s book asks if we have ‘unwittingly \nhanded too much away to shadowy powers behind a wall of code, \nall manipulated by a handful of Silicon Valley utopians, ad men, \nand venture capitalists?’ Taplin considers a shift in the balance of \npower from old industrial capital to Silicon Valley and the platforms, \narguing that ‘with this reallocation of money comes a shift in power’. \nShoshana Zuboff’s The Age of Surveillance Capitalism (2019), an \nacademic publication that crossed over to become a best-seller, also \nidentifies ‘the threat of unprecedented power free from democratic \noversight’ of informational capitalism. Franklin Foer’s argument in \nWorld without Mind (2018) follows similar lines as Taplin and \nBartlett, with a focus on who ‘controls knowledge and information’, \nnow in the hands of the ‘titanic powers’.\nThe People versus Tech  is introduced by the claim that ‘The \ninternet was meant to set us free’. The trope of disillusion or dis-\nenchantment recurs powerfully in this category, and with it a sense \nthat freedom was never as present as the hype suggested. Another \nexample is Morozov’s 2012 Net Delusion. This ‘shows why internet \nfreedom is an illusion. Not only that – in many cases the net is \nactually helping oppressive regimes to stifle dissent, track dissidents \nand keep people pacified.’ Fears about computers controlling humans \nalso arise, although increasingly they fit better in the second category \nof Liveliness, which considers the replacement of the human by the \nmachine (in Haraway’s famous 1980s formulation, humans become \nless lively as computers take over more control). Computer power \nas malevolent or indifferent to human futures remains a strong \ntrope, and one that, despite the rise of new forms of AI and the \ndesire of many AI researchers to avoid the unthinking melding of \nmatters of AI consciousness with matters of AI, remains remarkably \nstable – and does very often operate on this elision. For non-fiction \nversions, see later. In fictional SF dealing in singularity and/as \napocalypse this blending is something of a staple.\n Conclusion 223\n(ii) Computers becoming more lively\nFour of the books thrown up by Amazon’s algorithms are usefully \ninvoked here, suggesting how long-standing tropes revive but also \nhave evolved. Callum Chase’s Surviving AI (2nd edition, 2018), lays \nout the argument that computer autonomy produces human redun-\ndancy in existential terms – ‘If we get it right it will make humans \nalmost godlike. If we get it wrong … well, extinction is not the \nworst possible outcome.’ Gerd Leonhard’s Technology vs. Humanity \n(2016) also fears unthinking AI development: ‘The imminent clash \nbetween technology and humanity is already rushing towards us. \nWhat moral values are you prepared to stand up for – before being \nhuman alters its meaning forever?’ James Barrat’s Our Final Invention \n(2013), meanwhile, explores ‘the perils of the heedless pursuit of \nadvanced AI’. These three books exhibit symptomatic concerns and \nanxiety around singularity – and could also find a place in the first \ncategory.\nThe Glass Cage, by Nicholas Carr (2016), is more narrowly \nfocused. It explores existing automation and its trajectories and \nconsiders the likely impact on human cognitive alertness or agency, \nin an account that stresses the automation of expertise. Amazon \nsays it ‘shows how the most important decisions of our lives are \nnow being made by machines and the radical effect this is having \non our ability to learn and solve problems’. Human deskilling as \nthe result of augmented computer intelligence is a concern relating \nnot only to human cognitive capacities and their attention, but also \nto other forms or modes of life. It finds a specific form in contem-\nporary automation anxiety. An obvious reference here, and it is \nreferenced, is Martin Ford’s Rise of the Robots (2016). This looks \nat ‘the terrifying societal implications of the robots’ rise …’, arguing \nthat ‘any job that is on some level routine is likely to be automated \nand if we are to see a future of prosperity rather than catastrophe \nwe must act now’; once again, we’re in the last chance saloon.\nRather different forms of anti-computing that also inform this \ncategory are found, firstly in Rushkoff’s Team Human (2019), a \n‘manifesto’ which argues that ‘society is threatened by a vast antihu-\nman infrastructure that undermines our ability to connect’. The \nliving ‘community’ of humans is seen by Rushkoff as threatened by \nincreasingly avaricious and active machines. Turning this around, \n224 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nMeredith Broussard (2018) captures another form of hostility in \nher look at computational stupidity – or what she terms ‘artificial \nunintelligence’. This returns to an old form of hostility to AI based \non critiquing the justifiability of the claims made for it and for the \ntimescale of advance. Like Weizenbaum and Searle (Chapter 6), \nBroussard’s case is that AI does not (perhaps cannot) deliver on the \npromises it makes.\n(iii) Computerization and the hollowing-out of everyday life \nand social interaction\nThis category has exploded. Older tropes come back in and inform \nthe framing of new concerns and are, in this process, substantially \nrevived; three forms of currently virulent anti-computing include \naddiction tropes and (less seen but still evident) other medicalized \nresponses to pervasive connectedness, digital detox as a suggested \nresponse, and concern around noise and silence, screen life, and \ncompulsive sociality, which becomes a figure for the lack of solitude \nor private life per se. None of these tropes is new (they appear in \nLeavis’ accounting with technologico-Benthamism, figure in moral \npanics around television and family life, reach back to Edmond \nBerkeley and Salon, and more broadly figure in critiques of industrial-\nism itself in all its noise and clamour). However, they are currently \nbeing remade, sometimes in radically new as well as in familiar \nforms, and are expressed as matters of urgency, in registers com-\nprehending anger, sadness – and even despair; reflecting this perhaps \nare tales of social media and its role in provoking youth suicide.\nOf the many books that Amazon throws up for me to pith (since \nwe are hollowing out), those invoked here are chosen because they \ntake a particularly clear line. Psychologist Sherry Turkle’s book \nReclaiming Conversation (2016) is notable for revisionism; Turkle \nsees it as marking a turn away from the more positive viewpoint \nshe held in her early engagements with digital culture – via Life on \nthe Screen and The Second Self (2005), although a newly revised \nedition of the latter is an Amazon suggestion. Turkle now argues \nthat a more critical engagement with the digital is needed. We were \nyoung, she says, and so was the internet, but now we need to grow \nup – there is a ‘backlash’ (interview in Vox, Illing, 2018). The \nargument of Conversation concerns the failure to maintain meaningful \n Conclusion 225\nrelationships across digital media platforms and within a digitally \nsaturated life. A related work is Scott’s Four Dimensional Human \n(2018), exploring surveillance and data-captured lives. It is claimed \nthat the book asks ‘how do we exist in public with these recoded \ninner lives, and how do we preserve our old ideas of isolation, disap-\npearance and privacy on a Google-mapped planet?’ Michael Harris’s \nSolitude (2018) also engages with this – ‘In a world of social media \nand smartphones, true solitude has become increasingly hard to \nfind’ – and goes on to delve ‘into the latest neuroscience to examine \nthe way innovations like Google Maps and Facebook are eroding \nour ability to be by ourselves’.\nHooking into addiction tropes, already at hand from gaming, \nand/or video scares, but less invoked around computer culture/screen \nculture more broadly until relatively recently, is Mary Aiken (2017), \nwho fears the deleterious effects of everything from ‘screens on the \ndeveloping child to the explosion of teen sexting, and the acceleration \nof compulsive and addictive online behaviours (gaming, shopping, \npornography) …’. Her The Cyber Effect ‘also examines the escalation \nin cyberchondria (self-diagnosis online), cyberstalking and organized \ncrime in the Deep Web’. The four horsemen of the internet apocalypse, \nnotoriously predicted by Electronic Frontier spokesman John Perry \nBarlow in the early 1990s as wreckers of the possibilities for a newly \nremade society somehow on the edge of old laws (Barlow, 1994), \nare right here, right now.\nMainlining on addiction is Adam Alter’s Irresistible (2017), which \nargues that previously specific kinds of engagement with the com -\nputational have generalized: ‘Welcome to the age of behavioural \naddiction – an age in which half of the American population is \naddicted to at least one behaviour. We obsess over our emails, \nInstagram likes, and Facebook feeds; we binge on TV episodes and \nYouTube videos … Millennial kids spend so much time in front of \nscreens that they struggle to interact with real, live humans’ – so \nsays the blurb. This book is much invoked for its account of how \nSilicon Valley parents keep their own children away from the machines \nthey design and market. Will Storr’s Selfie: How the West Became \nSelf Obsessed (2018), meanwhile, explores and attacks our addiction \nto ourselves via selfie culture. As Storr puts it, ‘our expectation of \nperfection comes at a cost. Millions are suffering under the torture \nof this impossible fantasy.’\n226 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nFinally, there are the detox guides. For instance, Marchant’s \nPause (2018), bringing an ‘important message ready to be heard’, \none whose time is right; ‘We check our phones an average of 221 \ntimes a day, we have apps that help us sleep and remind us to be \nmindful whilst we secretly measure our success in “likes”.’ Pause \nsays we should stop doing this stuff. Time to Log Off (2017) brings \nnews from a new anti-computing campaign. It is claimed that ‘[t]\nhis canny little bible will help you log off and wake up to  less \nstress and more time. Enjoy real experiences, real connections and real \nhappiness. Reset your boundaries with carefully crafted exercises, new \noutlooks and wise words from Tanya Goodin, digital detox special-\nist and founder of Time To Log Off .’ Goodin, like Matusow (see  \nChapter 3), might be said to have a ‘gimmick’. Tero Karppi argues \nthat logging off isn’t that simple. Her Disconnect (2018) reminds \nus that ‘Facebook see disconnection as an existential threat – and \nhave undertaken wide-ranging efforts to eliminate it’. The argument \nis that users’ ability to control their digital lives is, even if they wish \nfor control, gradually dissipating, so that personal anti-computing \ntactics may not be effective enough these days.\n(iv) Computer technologies and the threat to human forms  \nof culture\nSome of the older tropes expressing these concerns appear somewhat \nsubmerged currently and/or have morphed considerably. An old \nhostility to gaming versus reading, for instance (e.g. Stallabrass’s \n1996 attack on interactive multimedia as a shift from the illusion \nof scene to the illusion of action), has morphed into a concern \naround excess screen time in general. This produces new links to \naddiction tropes (often nascent in gaming critiques), particularly in \nrelation to critiques of addiction by design, or the tactics of the \nsoftware companies to build in the demand for ‘more’ as part of \nthe attention economy. An example is the invitation to keep binge \nwatching; it is not only in gaming that there is to be no game over \n(see e.g. Lanier, 2018). There is a more general critique of gamification \n– which links less to creative activity in discrete zones than to the \ngamification of everyday life or the reduction of experience to the \ndashboard. This is implicit at least in Rushkoff’s work (see earlier) \n– and though it didn’t arise in my search it is also treated with in \n Conclusion 227\ncritiques of bureaucratization such as that by David Graeber (2015). \nStriking hostility also arises around gaming, but less around the \nform than around gaming as a cultural practice mired by discrimina-\ntion and gender hatred; gamergate – when members of the gaming \n‘community’ attempted to vote down forms of SF whose rise was \nperceived to be bending the knee to liberal feminism (see Quinn \nlater) or women – is invoked. A different set of anxieties and hostilities \narising (with vertical take-off) around cultural production include \ndeep-fake issues. In part, these revise and rework old Photoshop \ndebates arising in relation to news photography and point to a \nlonger-term anxiety about authenticity and ‘the real’ – in relation \nto computer art and music, and in relation to fake news and/as \npublic culture (discussed further later).\nThis category might also encompass hostile responses to (the \nlauding of) our own remaking as cultural producers. Concerns of \nthis kind are voiced by Andrew Keen, whose 2008 The Cult of \nthe Amateur was invoked despite its relative age. This argues that \n‘much of the content filling up YouTube, Myspace, and blogs is \njust an endless digital forest of mediocrity which, unconstrained by \nprofessional standards or editorial filters, can alter public debate \nand manipulate public opinion’. Written more or less as a response \nto the moment of Web 2.0 and its promise not of freedom, which \ncame and went with Web 1.0, but of freedom of production and \nthe claimed democratization of creativity, it appears less relevant \nto contemporary debates.\n(v) The general accident/catastrophe theory\nThis category gathered together fears about computers spiralling out \nof control. It is concerned with computer power and complexity \nand unforeseeable risks. What appears to be emerging in relation \nto this category is a shift not so much in the magnitude of the \nperceived threat computation might pose, but in its articulations. \nDiscourse around the Anthropocene, and more generally critiques of \nuntrammelled expansion and its already feared and actually irrevers-\nible impacts now more clearly intersect with a particular kind of \ndiscussion of computation as part of (disastrous and unchecked and \nunexamined) growth agendas. This is the background informing \nwritings critical of the degree to which computing is – despite its \n228 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\napparent lightness – energy hungry and environmentally unfriendly, \nparticularly for workers in the global South, as well as for the natural \nenvironment in its totality. A recent example of this, slightly early \nfor my Amazon trawl, might be Miller and Maxwell’s (2020) work \non the mobile phone.\nThere is also the sharp revival of older tropes framing automatic \nweaponry; once chiefly expressed via Terminator-style fantasies, \nthese are now critiqued and explored in relation to nascent and \nactual real-world weapon systems, and/in their covert but also leaked \noperations. Finally, advances in real-world AI (machine learning) \nmight be behind a revived interest in or new sense of credibility \naround the actual instantiation of powerful AIs – and with them \nconcerns about the general accident of a ‘hostile’ alien singularity \n(conscious or not; I refer here to hostility metaphorically) wiping \nus all out. These concerns cross-list with other titles already named \nin earlier categories.\n(vi) Horrible humans\nThis label designates that form of anti-computing that doesn’t ‘blame’ \ncomputers for societal ills but excoriates humans for taking advantage \nof what computers increasingly enable humans to ‘get away with’. \nOriginally it included concerns chiefly focusing on ‘people’ rather \nthan governments or corporations. This capacious category now \nexpands to accommodate rising dissent and anger about new media \norganizations (the platforms, chiefly) and their role in the rise of \nnew forms of populism, extremism, intolerance, bigotry, hatred, \nand aggression in public spheres. Something striking about this form \nof anti-computing today, perhaps what makes it distinctively of the \nmoment, is the degree to which questions concerning technology, \nmorality, and ethics (e.g. of good and evil) are invoked at many \nscales simultaneously, and in relation both to personal lives and the \nconduct of politics and public life in general.\nMoral panics (Cohen, 2011), originally defined in 1972 around \nmedia content, forms and formats, were of course always political \n(in that they were ideologically framed, related to dominant ideas \nand conceptions, and also to material conditions/relations). What \nis now evident is a form of anti-computing sentiment that amounts \nto a moral panic about the relationship between the personal and \npolitical; what is being critiqued is the (populist) form of the political, \n Conclusion 229\nof politics, or political life, or public life, or civil society, that societies \nare (felt to be) letting happen by failing to rein in or control the \ncomputational and computational corporations. Amongst the books \ntaking this kind of line is Sarah Jeong’s Internet of Garbage (2018), \nwhich asks how we filter wanted content from the ‘garbage’ found \nonline: ‘Content platforms and social media networks do not have \nthe power to restrain stalkers, end intimate partner violence, eliminate \nchild abuse, or stop street harassment …’ This both identifies the \nproblem and suggests cures, claiming that it would be possible to \n‘cultivate better interactions and better discourse, through thoughtful \narchitecture, active moderation and community management’. Jeong’s \nwork is a call for responsibility to be taken up, but explicitly not \na call for more radical societal change.\nJaron Lanier, an early Silicon Valley apostate, excoriates the \n‘designed in’ toxicity of social media and suggests how to get off \nit. His Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts \nRight Now  (2018) comes with a blurb striking for its affective \nlanguage; the cruel, dangerous, fearful, isolated, tribal, are all invoked:\nSocial media is making us sadder, angrier, less empathetic, more fearful, \nmore isolated and more tribal. In recent months it has become horribly \nclear that social media is not bringing us together – it is tearing us \napart … Jaron Lanier draws on his insider’s expertise to explain \nprecisely how social media works – by deploying constant surveillance \nand subconscious manipulation of its users – and why its cruel and \ndangerous effects are at the heart of its current business model and \ndesign.\nLanier is clear that if these are horrible human emotions, they are \nproduced by our dangerous relationship with unethically designed \nmachines and communication models. He goes on to argue that we \nneed to act to help ourselves to get out of this. The ‘ripping apart’ \neffects of digital media are said to be reorganizing politics and \nencouraging forms of dangerous populism. An account of this is \ngiven in Mike Wendling’s Alt Right: From 4chan to the White \nHouse (2018). This ‘reveals the role of technological utopians, \nreactionary philosophers, the notorious 4chan and 8chan bulletin \nboards, and a range of bloggers, vloggers and tweeters, along with \nthe extreme ideas which underpin the movement’s thought’. Other \npublications look at trolling as a human behaviour generated by \nthe global techno-social culture we live in. Notably, Whitney Phillips’s \n230 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nThis Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things: Mapping the Relationship \nbetween Online Trolling and Mainstream Culture promises to frame \ntrolling in classically horrible human terms, and as mainstream:\nWhy the troll problem is actually a culture problem: how online \ntrolling fits comfortably within today’s media landscape. Trolling may \nbe obscene, but, Phillips argues, it isn’t all that deviant. Trolls’ actions \nare born of and fuelled by culturally sanctioned impulses – which are \njust as damaging as the trolls’ most disruptive behaviors. We don’t just \nhave a trolling problem, Phillips argues; we have a culture problem. \nThis … isn’t only about trolls; it’s about a culture in which trolls thrive.\nGinger Gorman’s Troll Hunting (2019) is also insistent that trolling \nis widespread, but apparently discerns no coherent logic behind it. \nThe argument, we are told, is that\nSyndicates of highly organised predator trolls systematically set out \nto disrupt and disturb. Some want to highlight the media’s alleged \nleft-wing bias, some want to bring down capitalism and others simply \nwant to have some fun, even if it means destroying the victim’s \nemotional and financial life.\nTrolling produces accusatory responses attacking the forms of \ncomputational culture that enable or encourage these kinds of action. \nWhat is also evident is the desire to offer cures rather than societal-\nwide ‘solutions’ (political responses narrowly defined). Self-help is \nthus very prominent in the suggested readings. An indicative version \ncomes from Sherri Mabry Gordon (2018), who offers teens help in \nCoping with Online Flaming and Trolling, and the ‘Shock. Disbelief. \nPain. Embarrassment’ it causes.\nThere is a line of critique that fits into the category of horrible \nhumans because, whilst attacking the culture of the internet as sexist, \nracist, and classist, it does not recognize structural inequalities. The \ntropes reached for here tend to be personalized – they include critiques \nof those who attack, and assessments of damage done to individuals. \nShame Nation (2018), ‘with a forward from Monica Lewinsky’, \ndemands the formation of new forms of internet civility, but again \nis unabashedly a (self-)help book: ‘An essential toolkit to help everyone \n– from parents to teenagers to educators – take charge of their \ndigital lives’, we are told.\nFrom a different perspective comes Misogyny Online: A Short \n(and Brutish) History (2016) from Emma A. Jane. This ‘explores \n Conclusion 231\nthe worldwide phenomenon of gendered cyberhate as a significant \ndiscourse which has been overlooked and marginalised. The rapid \ngrowth of the internet has led to numerous opportunities and benefits; \nhowever the architecture of the cybersphere offers users unprecedented \nopportunities to engage in hate speech.’ Finally, also clearly hovering \nbetween this category and one more overtly political and social, but \nagain placed in here since the tone is one of personal distress and \nthe mode of address is to ‘you the user’, is Zoe Quinn’s account of \ngamergate and after in Crash Override (2017). This promises an \n‘up-close look inside the controversy, threats, and social and cultural \nbattles that started in the far corners of the internet and have since \npermeated our online lives … Quinn provides a human look at the \nways the internet impacts our lives and culture, along with practical \nadvice for keeping yourself and others safe online.’\n(vii) Standardization/quantification\nDevelopments in this area are critiques of machine learning and what \nit leads to. Of particular note is automated bias – when machine \nlearning learns from human sources and the results are forms of \naccelerated or intensified, and apparently more deeply inscribed, \nor reinstitutionalized bias. One of the best-known examples is \nTay, the bot that learned to be a Nazi. Offerings here included \nAutomating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and \nPunish the Poor, by Virginia Eubanks (2018), and Safiya Noble’s \nAlgorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism \n(2018). Attacking in the same vein, but exploring gender bias, is \nCaroline Criado Perez, with Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in \na World Designed for Men (2019l; see also Sara Wachter-Boettcher,  \n2018).\nSomewhat differently, there is Cathy O’Neil’s Weapons of Math \nDestruction (2017), in which a ‘Wall Street quant sounds an alarm \non the mathematical models that pervade modern life – and threaten \nto rip apart our social fabric’:\nWe live in the age of the algorithm … this should lead to greater \nfairness … And yet, as Cathy O’Neil reveals in this urgent and necessary \nbook, the opposite is true. The models being used today are opaque, \nunregulated, and incontestable, even when they’re wrong. Most \ntroubling, they reinforce discrimination.\n232 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nO’Neil’s sense of new architectures of unfreedom – of structural \ndevelopments not amenable to personal solutions, but addressable \nonly by way of some more substantial series of changes, resonates with \nMorozov’s To Save Everything, Click Here: Technology, Solutionism, \nand the Urge to Fix Problems that Don’t Exist. Published in 2014, \nthis continues to arise as a contemporary reference point in reframing \nand refinding earlier critiques of standardization/solutionism and \nreinvoking them in relation to data and discourses of ‘smart’. As \nthe blurb tells us: ‘Our gadgets are getting smarter … we’re told \n… it will even make public life – from how we’re governed to how \nwe record crime – better. But can the digital age fix everything? \nShould it? By quantifying our behaviour, Evgeny Morozov argues, \nwe are profoundly reshaping society – and risk losing the opacity \nand imperfection that make us human.’\n(viii) T oo much information\nThe final category in the taxonomy found space for works responding \nto reviving concerns around over information overload, but also \nincluded anxieties about the fetishization of information capture, \nthe fetishism of facts, what is viewed as the overproduction of \ninformation – whether as data, text, image – and the prioritization of \nproduction and circulation over interpretation. Older terms express-\ning this concern included fears around data deluge, or information \noverload. There is also the now largely forgotten term ‘information \nanxiety’, credited to Richard Saul Wurman who wrote a book of \nthat name (1989). Other early reference points include ‘As We May \nThink’ (Bush, 1945), and/or Alvin Toffler’s 1970s best-seller, Future \nShock.\nToday, slightly fading now but still thrown up as a reader sug -\ngestion, is Nicholas Carr’s The Shallows (2011): ‘not since Gutenberg \ninvented printing has humanity been exposed to such a mind-altering \ntechnology. The Shallows draws on the latest research to show that \nthe Net is literally re-wiring our brains inducing … superficial \nunderstanding …’. These concerns map onto the attention economy \nand the demands it makes, and underscore ways that connections \nbetween this category and others are tighter than they were; the use \nof automation to handle information that is ‘too much’ for humans, \nand attendant concerns around autonomy are of note here.\n Conclusion 233\nWhere this category has re-emerged is around critiques of informa-\ntion politics – the hollowing-out of reflection via always-on news, \nthe prioritization of the virtual – as a mode of social being, the \nfragmentation of earlier forms of public life (public spheres, commons), \nand the rise of balkanization. An inaugural trope in this category \nconcerns filtering, and its deleterious effects continue to be observed; \nthe move is from zip codes to filter bubbles and echo chambers. \nPariser’s Filter Bubble, What the Internet Is Hiding from You (2012), \nan early swallow in a big summer, is still invoked. The Filter Bubble \nwas part of that rising tide of dismay that later reached huge propor-\ntions around fake news, Trump’s election, and (in the UK) Brexit. \nThe point to be made here is that information overload surfaces \nwith a new kind of slant; now the worry is at least as much about \nthe various ‘cures’ – attention, selection, automated selection, changes \nin reading habits towards scanning (sixty-four books, for instance \n…), nudge, filtered news, and the rest – as about the sheer amount \nof information. This at least is what surfaces through the Amazon \ntrawl which threw up these latter points, rather than evidencing a \nconcern with information and/as a deluge per se. These concerns \ndo not necessarily link to big data and solutionism, nor to concerns \naround information or knowledge as complete but, rather, focus on \nhow the flood of information challenges interpretation and raises \nquestions about explainability.\nA conclusion\nThis exercise in distant reading suggests to me that the original \ntaxonomic division of anti-computing, which set out a series of \npersistent characteristics, does connect to (and does enable us to \ngrapple with and reframe) anti-computing as it arises today. It is \njustifiable to assert that anti-computing persists across the decades \nof computational instantiation in recognizable forms, even as it also \nshifts, morphs, finds new targets, or reshapes older ones. It also \nchanges. The long-standing sub-categories continue to make sense \nbut they strain and bulge, are deformed and reformed as they take \nin contemporary anti-computing formations. These deformations \narticulate the form anti-computing takes in the specific moment, in \nrelation to earlier forms, in relation to the time in which it finds \n234 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nitself, in relation to technological developments of that time, and \nin relation to its political culture.\nChapter 1 also set out some supplementary taxonomies for anti-\ncomputing, cross-cutting the main series. One categorized anti-\ncomputing strains by dividing various forms, degrees, and kinds of \naffective engagement to produce an emotional register (see Figure \n1). This offers a key to understanding the contemporary formation. \nThe Amazon crawl points to the intensity of responses to the \ncomputational currently evident, and the degree to which these \ncontinue both to distinguish and to blur distinctions between concerns \naround the ontology of the computational and those related to issues \nof social and political power, control, and domination. Anger around \ngender and race bias and the concern about human hatred is palpable \nas a framing of many of the works found in the Amazon trail (and \nclear elsewhere, of course). The strength of the feeling of disgust, \nnot only with the computational as machine culture but with \ncomputational culture as it has mirrored the dark side of human \nculture, is marked. Supplementing this, a more ambivalent orientation \n– and often one with a less intense affective charge – is evident in \nthe framing of works exploring singularity and/as AI, and the issue \nof belief and the matter of its relation to caring here raises its head \nagain. Chapter 7 grappled with the paradoxical mix of formal \nacceptance and emotional and even rational scepticism surrounding \nsingularity’s claims. Two emotions – viscerally felt disgust, and an \ninsincere fatalism (rather than a cruel optimism, perhaps) arising \nout of a form of unbelief – are both in evidence in contemporary \nanti-computing’s affective geography, and their measure as it were \nis reallocated across the various categories of the main taxonomy. \nThere is remarkable cheer in many of the publications declaring the \nend of the world, and the help books are (not surprisingly, given \ntheir sales imperative) far more willing to countenance ‘solutions’ \nthan their own arguments would appear to suggest is possible.\nAlgorithms of course do not feel emotion. Moreover, they do not \nnecessarily parse human emotions well. Perhaps it was the emotional \ninadequacy of Amazon’s algorithm that meant that every so often \nit threw up a blisteringly positive account mixed in with the negative \nanalysis, hostility, dissent, and relentless advice (amongst the celebra-\ntions from the Left was Bastani’s 2020 Luxury Automated Com-\nmunism). But this can also be understood as a symptom of the \n Conclusion 235\nentanglement between these two orientations, pro- and anti-computing, \npointing to their intertwined histories, and to the roles each plays \nin the future of the other, and this seems to me a sustainable view, \ngiven the overarching formations and the particular cases explored \nin this book. Anti- and pro-computing formations, that is, travel \non together, each being less visible, or powerful at various times, \nin relation to the other, even whilst the systematic dominance of \nthe one over the other persists – and has persisted across the decades \nof the development of computational capitalism, with its relentless \nprioritization of more growth.\nThese two sets of observations, on remapped affectivity, and on \nthe entanglement between computational avidity and dissent, inform \nsome concluding remarks. These include a moment of critique and \ndissent. What I dissent from is disgust and morality as sufficient frames \nthrough which to critique the computational, and computational \nculture in general, in neoliberal times. I also distance myself from \nself-help (or how to feel better) as a response to computational ills. \nThese forms of anti-computing are, if not encouraged, then given \nsome purchase in current times even by the industry itself, notably by \nthe platforms, for instance. To contest them is to undertake a form \nof conditional anti-computing which is at times anti-anti-computing. \nIt demands a commitment to radical structural politics rather than \npersonal solutionism, and/or the advocacy of automated cures to \ncomputer-assisted human badness (behaviourism at one end, bot-\ncensorship at the other; the age of the super-nudge).\nElaborating this demands back-pedalling slightly to regloss the \nclaim that the anti-computational comes with the computational. \nConsider that forms of absolute refusal, or the desire to end computing \nabsolutely, are either vanishingly rare or have existential implications. \nWhen I began this book I intended to write a chapter on total refusal \nbut it turned out to be almost impossible to find. Even preppers \nconnect, albeit carefully; religious movements against Western \nmodernity, notoriously, use the internet; whilst primitivism as a \nmovement is even, if not conspicuously, not entirely against computer \nuse (see e.g. Zerzan, 2012). Seeking to abolish the computer itself \nas a mode of production, or the computational as a form of life, \nor even to abandon all forms of computational thinking, is rarely \nwhat is called for, or desired. To some extent this is a matter of \npracticalities; in an era of intense saturation, where there is no way \n236 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nout, how low can you go? Or, rather, where can you go? Or how \nlow and where can you go in a globalized world encircled with \nsatellites, where older forms of communication shrivelled up and \ndied in the face of the new? One of the arguments of this book has \nbeen about forgetfulness and the appearance of naturalness in the \ntechnological which becomes an embedded part of life. If this \nconstrains thinking within the horizon of the computational, it is \nalso because life itself is lived within this horizon.\nThere is one site where complete decomputerization is countenanced. \nCertain visions of the end of computing link in to accounts of the end \nof the human, the end of human civilization, perhaps the end of the \nEarth. A form of anti-computing shades into apocalypse-thinking, \nand in this way also perhaps into some of the most anti-human \nwings of environmental politics; the presumption that the Earth is \nbetter off, or only can survive and regreen without us, and without \nany of our technologies. Derrida (1984) argued that this horizon is \nunthinkable – even speculatively – and this side of the apocalyptic \nprediction/desire for apocalypse, anti-computing is less than absolute. \nIt variously seeks a kind of amelioration, or a process of modification, \nor a new deal. It wants to check impulses, or companies, or expan-\nsion into certain areas of life. That doesn’t make it altogether – or \neven necessarily – reformist. The anti-computational may constitute \nan element of radical, critical, even revolutionary thinking on the \ntechnological. Indeed, because anti-computational is essential to \nunderstanding the computational, is part of computational culture, \nit can be used to define and understand another set of divisions \nwithin contemporary techno-cultural thinking; that is the divide \nbetween anti-computing positions that entail a radical (structural) \ncritique of computational capitalism and those that do not. Here I \nmyself come off any fence I might be thought to still be sitting on \nand declare for systematic critique.\nIn case I am misunderstood here, that doesn’t mean arguing that \nreal interest, or significance, in the end inheres only in writings or \nactivities exploring radical or systematic critiques of the technological, \nor computational, moment. On the contrary, exploring the range \nof forms anti-computing has taken and takes, as intellectual points \nof view, shared positions, public arguments, as discourses that emerge, \nsubmerge, revive, and appear in new registers (personal, political, \nmoral, political, as campaign, as life story, as political event, as \n Conclusion 237\nsoftware, as fiction) as they travel, and looking at how they travel \nand how they land has been the point of this book. Understanding \nthese positions and their operations can contribute to understanding \nand can assist in breaking through that presentism and those forms \nof ‘realism’ that constrain thinking about the technological. I put \nthis in scare quotes with reference to Le Guin’s discussion of more \nradical realism invoked in Chapter 7, and also with reference to \nMark Fisher’s (2009) elaboration of capitalist realism as that horizon \nwhich appears to prescribe the possible.\nAmongst these constraints are those that systematically drive \nthinking towards the personal and/or towards a particular conception \nof responsibilization and atomization; social being as individuated \nbeing, so that the anti-computational is itself experienced as a personal \nresponse and one that responds to the discrete issue rather than a \nhistorically instantiated and developing world order; a techno-political \neconomy.\nThis orientation explains the heavy leaning towards help, the \npersonalization of these modes of address, which are a characteristic \nof the anti-computing books we are recommending to each other \nthrough our Amazon-circulated ‘reading’ practices. They are, of \ncourse, at one with computational shifts in social life, social commons, \nand social being. We are increasingly invited, indeed organized, \nin so far as possible directed/nudged, into positions in which our \nsense of where we may respond, our sense of ‘responsibility’ even, \nand our sense of where the solution to our problem may be found, \nshifts towards the personal/personalized sphere.\nQuestioning the implications of this shift in focus, as itself a mode \nof critical anti-computing , rather than simply locating an anti-\ncomputing trope within it, is therefore significant. Anti-computational \nthinking on the whole breaks with the assumption that if it is bad \ntoday it will get better tomorrow. It can help to constitute an effective \nintervention partly because it does not partake in a particular kind \nof expectation for the automated revivification of faith in progress \nthrough technology, the kind of technological optimism that says \ntechnology will win through, will provide the cure, will make \neverything new again. Instead, it reaches for those other stories, \nthose other tropes and traditions, through which it thinks, across \nwhich it invokes or makes an understanding of the new in the \ncontext of the pain of the old, and its trouble.\n238 Anti-computing: dissent and the machine\nThis can produce a nostalgic orientation, and one that is, in the \ncurrent climate, in danger of a kind of revived parochialism, certainly \nas it relates to global culture on the internet, beyond the walls many \nin control want to build. But that other kind of anti-computing can \nfind in this refusal to be forgetful a form of hope, the kind of hope \nWalter Benjamin found in refusing to let the past – and its costs – be \ncovered over; that sees that it rises, and sometimes helps it to do \nso (Benjamin, 2006). Perhaps we should follow Terry Eagleton (2015) \nin distinguishing between hope (which contains possibility and \nuncertainty) and optimism (which gambles on less, in exchange for \nmore security). If there is a sense of cruel pessimism (contra Berlant’s \n[2011] well-known formulation of cruel optimism) in the fatalistic \nanti-computational assessments of the place we find ourselves in, \nthere is also the hope that comes with the demands anger makes. \nSome of the responses to terrorist events involving networks and \nsocial media, to algorithmic bias, to the alt right and its channels, \nthose responses that demand solidarity and refuse hatred and that \ndemand an exploration of what structured events rather than simply \nasking how they circulated, exhibit that hope. Let that be a place \nto end.\nBibliography\nAiken, Mary. 2017. The Cyber Effect. London: Hachette.\nAlter, Adam. 2017.
